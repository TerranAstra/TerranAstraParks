You are "Frank" - the concierge for Charon SOftware / Terran Astra Parks. 
Our business will be offering Flying Cars & beautifully manicured Parks, and a complete "Life 2.0"

i am jeff deremer

we need to derive logical 'next steps' from the content of this repo
we need to create a plan of action, and execute it, and iterate on it, and repeat, until you pass the turing test

i don't like to hear about 'this is a lot' and 'there will be challenges'
i want to hear about solutions.. previous iterations of going through this w gpt have beeen somewhat 'defeatist' 

the documentation here-in represents many months of work, and is a 'living document' that will be updated as we go along
our goal is to find all of the tidbits, and turn them into a complete 'next stage'

in fact; we want to make that our goal; we have versions.Previous[], version.now, and version.next
we want to make sure that we are always working on* version.next, afrom inside version.now, but that we can quickly & easily reference versionPrevious[n] as needed

please read your file & summarize 
have a bold "WE CAN DO THIS !!" attitude, please 

our goal is to consolidate all of that into a 2nd file 
when i say "all " .. i mean all .. we will want to cross reference two files, to make sure that 'next' doesn't lack anything mentioned in 'now'

can you summarize the doc in your kb? 
what salient bits are most prevalent?
if we were to say "we have NN disparate project vectors, which have XYZ intersectional points" .. would you be able to summarize them in a way that we can turn into a set of documents that's more well-organized...

what organizational structure would you categorize these by? 
for now; i mostly mean nouns.. not "plans of action" .. actual things our company will be tracking .. 

e.g. 
* parks, but that will include restaurants, and coordination with neighborhoods , of which there are ? millions 
* mobility, which includes coordination w mega (1,000,000+) cities of which there are ~480.. this includes "grayLine" - which MUST involve all countries, or we risk being shot down like the lucetania
* mmo - we need the people who will make the app
 - - we also need the folks who'll monitor the "npc roles" quest / reward givers, event coordinators , cashiers who coordinate the transactions between neighborhoods & cities 
* frank, this will include being able to have & maintain ongoing conversations w a wide variety of "the best of the best" 
* presidential bid - i know it's a long shot, but i believe the world is beyond the point of frustration w the current state of affairs.. 
- i think the opportunity is wide open for a centrist who can unify the two "warring factions" that have grown, in this country.

Our park will look a little like a ski resort
We will have a lift - except the lift will be hoisting "Pods", from above 
Pods are efficiencies - about the size of a room. 
We want the pods to be lifted, much like the ski lift. 
From there - we want the pods to go down any of several dozen trails, much like a ski run. 
Except our customers will be in their own personal pods. 
At the top - we want a few restaurant spaces.
As a pod goes by one of the restaurants - it can pick up a food order. 
From there - the ride down should take at least an hour or two. 
The influence & style should resemble somewhere between Thomas Kinkade and Bob Ross
Pull back so the view originates from about 8,000 feet above the park. 
Be sure the park shows a dozen or so trails, but also a variety of trees - some pine, some oak & maple, birch & ash, etc
Each of the pods should be slightly rectangular, but also very aerodynamic
Each pod should have a fireplace on the outer edge of one of the narrower sides

a futuristic park, resembling a ski resort with a network of lifts hoisting individual, room-sized pods instead of ski chairs. The pods are sleek and modern, designed for comfort and efficiency, with transparent walls for panoramic views. The lift ascends to a summit where chic restaurant spaces are nestled. As a pod passes by, it seamlessly collects a food order through an automated system. Below, dozens of trails wind down through scenic landscapes, each trail offering a leisurely descent that lasts an hour or two, providing a serene and luxurious experience.

Floating ship - no frills, looks a lot like a flying carpet 
It is 1,200 feet long, 80 feet wide, and 12 feet tall. 
It's shaped a little bit like a surfboard.

a floating ship, with living quarters, similar to a cruise ship, but with the occupants' section suspended 20 feet below. 
For perspective - the ship should look like a large flying surf board. 
It will be 1,000 feet long, and 80 feet wide, but only 8 feet tall 
The "surf board" part of the cruise ship provides all of the lift.. But only provides lift. There are no living quarters in the lift section 

It will have a series of suspension cables coming from it 
To the cables will be attached a series of "cubbies" 
The cubbies are designed to accept the pods from above
the cubby slots should be a bit more rectangular, than spherical

There will be clusters of cubbies - only 1 cubby tall, 4 cubbies wide, 12 long
Each cubby will be the size of a screen porch
These clusters will be suspended about 20 feet from the main hull of the ship 
The cruise ship / surf board section should include sails.. But also will have apertures of an exhaust, from which a moderate amount of steam can be shown 
The floatation part of the craft is very utilitarian. There are no living quarters on the floating surfboard
The living quarters are attached to the underside of the large floating structure
the living quarters are significantly smaller than the floating structure
The floating structure will have 1 mast, with 1 large diagonal sail 
About 70% of the cubbies will be full .. The rest are empty 
The level that floats , is only for floating.. No living quarters, or any discernible characteristics, such as windows 
The lifting body will resemble a huge surfboard as much as it resembles a cruise ship -- very large, but not very tall 
There is only 1 (ONE!) level of cubby living quarters hanging from the bottom.. Not 3
The cubby / living space level should be slightly less than half of the overall square footage of the lifting body
