The **Terran Astra Compendium** outline is now drafted! It provides a **clear, structured foundation** that both **humans and AI can navigate easily**.  

This framework ensures **all aspects of Terran Astra are connected** while remaining **modular and scalable**. We can now start **expanding each section** with detailed descriptions, visuals, and technical documentation.  

Whatâ€™s next? Do you want to **flesh out specific sections**, or should we **start building the communication system** to attract the right people? ðŸš€
