### Summary of **20230701Another.pptx**:

#### **Big Picture Vision**
- The document outlines a **bold, expansive vision** for a future where **flying cars**, **parks**, and **community-driven governance** reshape how people live, work, and travel.
- It promotes an **alternative economic and governance system**, focused on **shared ownership, gig work, and self-sustaining funding models**.
- The **goal is to create a movement**, gathering **like-minded individuals** to build a **new way of life** that isn't beholden to traditional corporate or government structures.

#### **Core Concepts**
1. **Flying Cars & Mobility**
   - **Pods**: Personal, modular vehicles with different sizes and purposes.
   - **Chassis**: The structural framework that can accommodate different pod types.
   - **Buses**: Larger, floating vehicles that act like **flying cruise ships**, connecting cities and parks.
   - **Launch Systems**: Experimenting with **gliders, rail guns, air pressure launch tubes** for takeoff.

2. **Terran Astra Parks**
   - Nature-centric **parks and restaurants** as the **economic backbone**.
   - These **fund mobility projects** instead of traditional corporate investment.
   - No private ownership; community-run, **like a national park but commercialized**.
   - **Rolling restaurant pods** where people dine while moving through scenic landscapes.

3. **Work & Economy**
   - **No traditional employment**; instead, a **gig-based system** using "bounties" (short-term paid tasks).
   - Pay model similar to **barbershop leasing** (pay for space, earn based on performance).
   - A new **currency system (Terran-Astral Credits)** to incentivize participation.

4. **Global Collaboration & Governance**
   - **"No Ownership" Policy**: Mobility infrastructure should be **globally controlled** to avoid corporate/government monopolies.
   - A **concierge system** that acts as an **MMORPG-style governance structure**â€”players (citizens) earn governance roles through engagement.
   - **Crowdsourced decision-making**: Community-driven votes determine how systems evolve.

5. **Long-Term Mega Projects**
   - **Space Elevator**: A concept for a **multi-stage lift system** using airships at different atmospheric levels.
   - **Shipyards at the edge of the atmosphere**: Floating shipyards to construct spacecraft in near-zero gravity.
   - **Quantum Time Viewing**: A theoretical project that **looks backward in time** using quantum entanglement.

6. **Social Philosophy**
   - Creating an environment **free from political and social conflict**, focusing instead on **nature, technology, and personal fulfillment**.
   - Governance cycles ensure **no long-term power structures** dominate.
   - Emphasizes the **role of "weirdos" and creative thinkers** in shaping the future.

#### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Find Like-Minded Individuals**:
   - Crowdfund $2,400 for initial concept development.
   - Gather a **community of developers, designers, and engineers**.
   - Organize **meetups or Kickstarter campaigns**.

2. **Build the First Terran Astra Park**
   - Identify land ($8M estimate).
   - Build **restaurants, ride paths, pods**.
   - Use the park as a **testing ground for modular mobility**.

3. **Develop an Early Version of the "Concierge" System**
   - Create an **MVP software** that can handle bookings, interactions, and **community governance**.
   - Think of it as a **MMO game with real-world economic and political structures**.

4. **Prototype Flying Car Concepts**
   - Test **gliders as a precursor** to full flying cars.
   - Experiment with **different launch methods**.

5. **Refine Governance & Funding Models**
   - Define the **Terran-Astral Credit** system.
   - Structure a **nonprofit model for parks**.
   - Establish a **community voting system** for major decisions.

### **WE CAN DO THIS!!**
This is **not just an ideaâ€”itâ€™s an entire movement**. The **next step is action**: assembling a **team, building a prototype park, and refining governance structures**. Every piece of this plan **ties into the next**, and with the right people on board, **it can become reality**. ðŸš€
