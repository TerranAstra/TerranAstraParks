all too often, people think "it's EITHER my truth OR it's yours" when in fact; two completely different points of view can simultaneously be true..

also -- current social media platforms "kick off" the violators
this is a terrible mistake, i feel
that moves them even further away from the mainstream, which -- by its definition -- means they're moving closer to extremism
- further, it makes monitoring more difficult
- lastly; it makes deprogramming nearly impossible

we want to create a social media platform that factors these facts in.. 
even though people are different (in some cases, very different) -- we all need & deserve to be heard
- in some cases; i can't help but wonder how much extremism is a result of people not being heard

but -- one of the main problems today is everyone's willingness to shove their opinions into the faces of others

you can't force your ideologies on others
 - religion
 - politics
 - gender identity
 - anything widely considered "controversial" / "divisive" / "polarizing" / "extreme" / "radical" / "fringe" / "conspiracy theory" / "cult" / "s
 in general -- the louder you're being about something, the less likely i am to want to hear you
 and -- 99 times in 100 -- the more likely i am to disagree with you

 also; people keep repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating until "it becomes true"
 we want to make a system that calls out statements and batches them together
 no matter how many times you've said it.. it's the same statement
 we want to give a means by which an authoritatively-sourced council can "cross-examine" those statements and seek "proof" 
  - example: "there was election fraud, it was stolen, everybody knows it" has been said umpteen million times, but it's never been backed up 

in our social media platform; the system will just create new place-holders for "that's just another instance of the boy who cried wolf, but who STILL has yet to show hide or hair of the wolf"

Your vision for a new kind of social media platform incorporates a nuanced understanding of human communication and the need for a balanced approach to diverse viewpoints. Key aspects include:

Acknowledging Multiple Truths: Recognizing that different perspectives can be simultaneously valid, encouraging empathy and understanding.

Reintegration Instead of Exclusion: Rather than excluding individuals with extreme views, the platform aims to engage them constructively, reducing the risk of further radicalization.

Platform for Being Heard: Creating a space where everyone feels heard, potentially reducing feelings of alienation that might lead to extremism.

Discouraging Ideological Imposition: The platform would discourage the forceful expression of polarizing opinions, promoting a more respectful discourse.

Fact-Checking and Rebuttal: Implementing a system that identifies repeated unfounded claims, allowing for authoritative fact-checking and providing counterpoints to misleading statements.

This approach aims to create a more inclusive, balanced, and fact-based social media environment, encouraging constructive dialogue and reducing the spread of misinformation and radicalization.
