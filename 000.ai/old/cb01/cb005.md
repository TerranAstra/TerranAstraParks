i want to tackle this concern right up front 

5. Potential Challenges
Standardization: Different APIs may have different standards and practices, making standardization challenging.

if it's challenging, that's ok
if it's impossible, i would prefer to not go on a wild goose chase

this challenge addresses exactly the purpose behind doing this project in the first place
we need to be able to say "all (ALL!) APIs share xyz pieces"
 - at a minimum .. that includes:
   - company (the name of the company that publishes the api)
   - verb (put, get, post, etc. - if applicable.. our wrapper should be able to handle all verbs, including if there aren't any)
   - URL (ALL APIs have a URL.. one day, there could be additional functionality based on something other than REST over HTTP - but for now, we're talking about REST over HTTP)
   - parameters (if applicable)
   - timeout (if applicable)
   - callback/hooks (if applicable)
   - payload (if applicable)
   - examples (maintained as part of )
   - documentation
   - - some of it theirs, as ingested reference materials, converted into one common format (language agnostic, preferably)
   - - some of it ours, as a wrapper, broken down by user, neighborhood/city, 
   
the goal of all of this is the be able to use "lingua franka nouns" with L.F. verbs, and make L.F. sentences 

examples

Company: Coinbase
URL[1]: https://api.coinbase.com
Verb: Get
    but also, edit .. 
EndPoint: /v2/prices/spot?currency=USD
Example: fully-functioning example of this call, also maintained in versioning
{
    "data": {
        "amount": "101.00",
        "currency": "USD"
    }
}
Each call would/could be 
 - logged
 - tracked
 - versioned
 - documented
 - tested
 - etc 

 we want to wrap all of this , in a homeGrown knock-off of "Postman": https://www.postman.com/company/open-philosophy/
 so if you are able to find and recreate their source code - that's great too

 Your vision for a universal API wrapper that leverages a common language (Lingua Franca) and structure to standardize disparate APIs is ambitious and forward-thinking. Tackling the standardization challenge is not impossible, but it requires careful planning and consideration of the diverse nature of APIs. Here's a strategic approach to address this:

1. Common Structure Identification
Identifying and defining a common structure that can encapsulate the varied nature of different APIs is crucial. Your list (company, verb, URL, parameters, etc.) is a great start. This structure will serve as the backbone of your wrapper, ensuring that even diverse APIs can be represented in a standardized format.

2. Flexible and Extensible Design
Adaptability: Design the wrapper to be adaptable to different API standards. This means having a core structure but allowing for extensions or modifications where necessary.
Metadata Driven: Use metadata to describe API-specific peculiarities. This can include additional parameters, special handling instructions, or custom processing rules.
3. Unified Interface for API Interaction
Abstraction Layer: Develop an abstraction layer that interacts with the APIs. This layer will translate the common structure into the specific calls required by each API.
Dynamic Handling: Incorporate dynamic handling of API requests based on the defined structure, allowing for different verbs, parameters, callbacks, etc.
4. Version Control and Documentation
Centralized Repository: Maintain a centralized repository for all API configurations, examples, and documentation.
Automated Documentation: Explore tools or methods to automatically generate and update documentation based on the API configurations and changes.
5. Integration with Existing Tools
Leverage Existing Tools: While recreating tools like Postman from scratch is a huge undertaking, consider integrating with or leveraging existing tools for aspects like testing and version control.
API Testing and Monitoring: Develop a subsystem for testing API calls, monitoring their performance, and logging their usage.
6. Challenges and Solutions
Security and Privacy: Implement robust security measures for handling sensitive information, such as API keys and personal data.
Performance Optimization: Ensure the wrapper is optimized for performance, avoiding unnecessary overhead.
7. Postman Open Source Alternative
Open Source Exploration: While directly recreating Postman’s source code isn’t feasible due to copyright issues, you can explore open-source alternatives or inspirations, like Swagger or Insomnia, for ideas on building a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.
Custom Development: Develop custom functionalities that align with your specific needs, inspired by the best practices observed in tools like Postman.
8. Prototype and Community Feedback
Iterative Development: Start with a basic prototype and iteratively enhance it based on testing and feedback.
Community Engagement: Engage with the developer community for feedback, contributions, and testing, especially if you plan to make this an open-source project.
This project represents a significant step towards a more integrated, efficient, and standardized approach to handling APIs, potentially influencing the way APIs are interacted with and managed in the broader developer community.
