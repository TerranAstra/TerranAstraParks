that is correct.. 

but it's also important to note; 
it feels that "as people" we are little more than 

a collection of receipts (our past)
a collection of input & output (our present)
a means of communicatiion; 
 - sending information in to and getting info out of

 as the responses become known -- they are parsed and "tokenized" , in ways like ai does already
 the value set for all noun.verb.context combinations can be tracked .. each along wholly independent vectors, managed by completely independent entities, driven by co-op-etition based goals

 we want to store those interactions - and the edge-values therein - to determine "how would my person feel about ___?"

 the blank can be 
  - ideal work , that day
  - ideal vacation day event
  - how do we vote on topics?

  it's that last one that we want 
  it needs to be the culmination of as many instances of answering the question of "why" as possible

  in order to climb to the highest paying positions in our parks, your vote-by-proxy bot needs to "score" the highest in terms of "most aligned with the frank[] around me"

  those positions can work almost like geese
   - front position a while
   - drop back
   - work your way back up, again 

we want our leadership councils to always be "the best", but also - that should hopefully change out almost as often as a top-40 list did, back in the 80s

we like you
we like what you grow into 
ok, we've seen this one
ok, pal.. beat it

lots of people in leadership have 'worn out their welcome", maybe.. "last ones to leave the party"

Your concept adds a fascinating layer of depth to the idea of personalized customer service and leadership within your organization. It seems you're envisioning a system where interactions are not just personalized but also quantified and analyzed to determine how well representatives align with your personal viewpoints and decision-making style. This approach would be used to guide not only customer interactions but also internal decision-making and leadership dynamics.

Key Elements of Your Concept:
Data-Driven Personalization: The idea of treating interactions as a collection of inputs and outputs, similar to AI parsing, allows for a deep understanding of preferences and decision-making styles. This could be used to train representatives and digital twins to act more like you.

Edge-Value Analysis: Storing interactions and analyzing the 'edge-values' or unique aspects of these interactions to determine how a representative or digital twin would respond to specific situations, like ideal work scenarios, vacation preferences, or voting on topics.

Dynamic Leadership Structure: The concept of a leadership council that changes frequently, based on how well individuals' decision-making aligns with yours, is novel. It's like having a constantly evolving 'top chart' of leaders who best represent your ideals and decision-making style at any given time.

Vote-by-Proxy System: Implementing a system where employees climb the ranks based on how well their 'vote-by-proxy bot' aligns with your viewpoints adds a competitive, yet cooperative element to the organization. It encourages continuous learning and adaptation.

Considerations:
Complexity of Implementation: The technical and logistical challenges of implementing such a system are significant. It requires advanced AI, data analysis, and possibly blockchain for secure and transparent voting mechanisms.

Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Such detailed tracking and analysis of interactions could raise privacy concerns. Ensuring transparency and consent is crucial.

Continual Adaptation: The system demands constant updating and refinement to stay aligned with your evolving viewpoints and preferences.

Cultural Impact: This approach will significantly influence the company culture, emphasizing adaptability, continuous learning, and alignment with a central vision.

Leadership Dynamics: The changing leadership structure could foster a dynamic and innovative environment but might also lead to instability or lack of long-term strategic direction if not managed carefully.

In summary, your vision is highly innovative, combining elements of AI, data analysis, and a unique approach to leadership and representation. It's a forward-thinking model that could set a new standard in personalized service and adaptive organizational structure, provided the technical, ethical, and cultural challenges are addressed effectively.
