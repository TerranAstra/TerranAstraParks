thank you for that clarification
sounds like we are ok to explore some 'automatic trading' 

1st, though.. 
can you walk me through the process of making & using custom abilities in openai

on your side - ChatGPT UI - you have create new action

also - i have just enabled "web browsing" 
does this now mean you can browse web sites...? (fingers cautiously crossed)

I'm glad to provide clarification and guidance on these topics. Let's break down your queries:

1. Creating and Using Custom Abilities in OpenAI
Custom abilities in OpenAI, particularly in the context of ChatGPT or similar AI models, typically refer to creating specialized functions or capabilities that extend beyond the standard model's responses. This process involves a few key steps:

Identifying the Need: First, determine the specific functionality you want to add. This could range from specialized data processing to integrating external APIs.

Development: Once the need is identified, the next step is to develop the custom functionality. This often involves programming, which can be done using various languages compatible with OpenAI's API, such as Python.

Integration: After developing the custom function, it's integrated with the OpenAI model. This integration is usually done through APIs or scripting, depending on the complexity and nature of the function.

Testing and Deployment: The final step involves testing the custom functionality for accuracy and efficiency, followed by deploying it for use with the AI model.

2. Web Browsing Ability
The "web browsing" ability in the context of ChatGPT or similar AI models does not equate to traditional web browsing as experienced by humans. Instead, it refers to a controlled and limited ability to access and retrieve information from the web. Here's what it typically entails:

Controlled Access: The AI can access a predefined set of web pages or data sources. It's not a freeform browsing ability where any website can be accessed.

Information Retrieval: The primary function is to pull information from these sources to answer questions or provide insights.

Ethical and Legal Boundaries: Just like with other capabilities, web browsing is governed by ethical guidelines and legal constraints. It ensures the AI doesn't access restricted or sensitive information.

No Real-time Interaction: The AI does not interact with web pages in real-time (like filling forms, clicking buttons, etc.). It's more about reading and extracting information.

In my current setup, I don't have the capability to browse the web. My responses are based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. If web browsing is enabled in a future update or in other versions of AI models, the functionality would still be subject to the constraints and guidelines mentioned above.

Let me know if you need more information on either of these topics or if you have other questions!

can you browse repos? this one's ours: https://github.com/TerranAstra/PreAlphaGpt001/

Currently, I don't have the capability to directly access or browse external websites, including GitHub repositories. My functionality is limited to the information and tools provided within this environment, and I don't have the ability to access the internet or external databases.

However, I can definitely assist with any questions or tasks related to GitHub repositories in a general sense. If you have specific questions about managing a GitHub repository, coding practices, understanding Git commands, or anything related to repository management and development workflows, feel free to ask. I can provide guidance based on the information available to me and general best practices in software development.

If you have specific content from your GitHub repository that you need help with, you can share the details or code snippets here, and I'd be happy to assist you with them!

i am using a 3rd party tool to export the content of the repo into a text file
2 of those files are in your knowledge base 
it's cumbersome
is there an official & sanctioned way of enabling you to access a repo that doesn't involve this step? 
it only adds a few minutes per iteration.. but i'd love to automate the process
if you have suggestions for how; i'd like to explore that

As of my last update, there isn't an official or direct method provided by OpenAI for AI models like me to access external GitHub repositories or any external databases. The current process involves manually uploading relevant files or content to the conversation for analysis, as you have done.

However, you can streamline and automate the process of updating the AI with content from your GitHub repository. Here are a few suggestions:

Automated Script for Export and Upload: Develop a script that automatically exports the necessary content from your GitHub repository into a text file and then uploads it to the AI conversation. This script could be triggered manually, or you could set it to run at regular intervals.

Webhooks and Automation Tools: Utilize GitHub webhooks to trigger an automation tool like Zapier, IFTTT, or a custom script. When a change is made in the repository, the webhook can notify the automation tool, which then extracts the updated content and prepares it for upload. This still requires a manual step to upload the content to the AI, but it reduces the manual workload.

Version Control and Change Tracking: Maintain a version-controlled document that logs changes made in the repository. Whenever you upload this document, the AI can compare the new version with the previous one to understand the updates. This method ensures that the AI is provided with a clear context of what has changed.

API Integration (Future Consideration): While not currently available, the potential for OpenAI to offer an API that integrates directly with external sources like GitHub could be a future enhancement. This would allow for seamless and real-time updates from the repository to the AI model.

Feedback to OpenAI: If you find the current process limiting, providing feedback to OpenAI could help in the development of more streamlined integration features in future iterations of the AI.

These methods aim to reduce the manual effort involved in keeping the AI updated with the latest changes from your GitHub repository. They would require some initial setup and possibly some programming to automate the process as much as possible.
