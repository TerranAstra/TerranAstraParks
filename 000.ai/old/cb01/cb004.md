i want to explore an "api wrapper"

i want to be able to define functionality in common language terms, in a dictionary

the terms can be definitions of the actions
but also - the code that is to be executed

for each; there is so much more they have "in common" than they have "different", that it's insane to continually re-write the same code over and over again for the different api

though they're all different URLs with parameters, timeouts, callbacks, payloads, etc.. 
 - they're all the same in the sense that they're all 
  - - "api calls", 
  - - with names, 
  - - definitions, and 
  - - code to be tracked via version, 
  - - commonalities between languages used, 
  - - a need for having payloads stored and analyzed through a common pipeline,
  - - a need for having logging & error handling in a common pipeline,
  - - a need to move away from today's paradigm of 9,000,000 "silos" of programming, each doing the same
  - - a need to move towards a paradigm of "commonality" and "re-use" and "sharing" and "collaboration" and "open source" and "open data", etc..

i want to be able to define the "api wrapper" in a dictionary

we need to look at the commonalities that are shared by the different api's

at a high level:
 - company
 - verb
 - URL
 - parameters
 - timeout
 - callback/hooks (if applicable)
 - payload (if applicable)
 - logging
 - error handling
 - version control, by way of "intermediary"
 - language(s) used
 - etc..

Creating an API wrapper with a focus on commonalities and reusability is a great idea, especially in the context of enhancing efficiency and promoting a more collaborative, open-source approach. Your concept of defining API functionalities in common language terms and implementing them in a dictionary-like structure is innovative and practical. Let's break down the approach:

1. Defining the Structure of the Dictionary
Your dictionary or configuration file will store information about each API in a structured format. Here’s an example structure based on your description:

json
Copy code
{
    "API_Name": {
        "company": "Company Name",
        "verb": "GET/POST/etc.",
        "url": "https://api.company.com/endpoint",
        "parameters": {
            "param1": "value1",
            "param2": "value2"
        },
        "timeout": 30,
        "callback": "optional callback details",
        "payload": "optional payload details",
        "logging": true,
        "error_handling": "defined method",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "languages": ["Python", "JavaScript"]
    }
}
2. Creating the Wrapper
The wrapper will be a piece of software that interprets this dictionary and makes API calls accordingly. Here’s a simplified concept:

Reading the Dictionary: The wrapper reads the API configuration from the dictionary.
Making API Calls: Based on the configuration, it constructs and makes the API request.
Handling Responses: It processes the API response, applying any defined callbacks or payload processing.
Error Handling and Logging: Implements a unified approach to logging and error handling as defined in the dictionary.
3. Implementation Considerations
Language Agnostic: Ideally, this wrapper should be developed in a way that it can be used across multiple programming languages, or at least easily translatable.
Extensibility: The design should allow for easy addition of new APIs and modifications of existing ones.
Version Control: Implement a system to track and manage different versions of the API configurations.
Security: Ensure that the wrapper handles sensitive data (like API keys) securely.
Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for how to use the wrapper and how to add new API configurations.
4. Development Steps
Prototype: Start by creating a basic version of the wrapper with a few APIs to validate the concept.
Expand and Refine: Gradually add more APIs, refine the error handling, logging, and other shared functionalities.
Community Input: If you plan to make this open-source, getting input from the community can be invaluable for identifying common needs and potential improvements.
5. Potential Challenges
Standardization: Different APIs may have different standards and practices, making standardization challenging.
Security and Privacy: Ensuring that all APIs are accessed securely, and private data is handled appropriately.
Performance: Balancing the abstraction and common functionality with the performance needs of different APIs.
This approach aligns well with the modern shift towards microservices architecture and API-driven development, fostering a more integrated and efficient development environment. Remember, the success of such a project also depends significantly on the clarity of documentation and ease of adoption for developers.
