let's switch gears to coinbase
we want you to be able to perform some estimations, and make the big $$
question 1 -- is that OK? are you allowed to help programmers like me create systems that will -- because you are AI, after all -- give me an unfair advantage in the market?

i am eager to make money, but i don't want either of us to get in trouble with the law

It's important to clarify the ethical and legal boundaries in this context. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I can provide general information, guidance, and assistance with programming and data analysis related to financial markets and cryptocurrency, including working with platforms like Coinbase. However, there are several key limitations:

No Insider Trading or Market Manipulation: I cannot assist with or participate in any activities that would constitute insider trading, market manipulation, or any other illegal or unethical practices.

No Financial Advice: I am not licensed to provide specific financial or investment advice. My role is to offer technical assistance and information, not to guide personal investment decisions.

Compliance with Regulations: Any system or strategy developed should comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including those pertaining to financial markets and trading.

Fair Use: While AI can analyze data and trends, it's crucial to use this information fairly, without seeking to gain an unfair advantage in the market.

Given these guidelines, I can help develop systems for analyzing market trends, understanding cryptocurrency dynamics, or automating certain aspects of trading based on publicly available information and ethical practices. Any such development should be done with a focus on legal compliance and ethical considerations.

If you have specific programming or analytical tasks within these boundaries, feel free to detail them, and I'll assist to the best of my ability
