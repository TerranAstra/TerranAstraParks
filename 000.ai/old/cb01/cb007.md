i want to discuss this:

Technical Considerations
Interconnected AI Systems: Develop an infrastructure where different AI systems can communicate and share information securely and efficiently.

that is the primary intent of the new lingua franka 

it's not just a human language

it's intended as a means for these widely disparate frank[] entities to communicate with one another, look out for their person, but also provide some much-needed respect for the other frank[] entities

this world lacks personal accountability

the only tool at anyone's disposal is the threat of jail

i want to add "restriction of access" (/ "timeouts" if we want to disparage) to that list
if you are a person who is not willing to be a part of the solution, then you are going to take a break from the parks for a while

and that means glide rides, trail rides past waterfalls, bus rides around the world, and even access to the compassionate and helpful bot named Frank that was learning to emulate your every preference, be your chauffeur, your personal assistant, tell you jokes, find you your favorite foods, take you to fun events in the parks, and even walk you through learning new hobbies and skills

the meerkat[] network will be a chatty always-on co-op-etition of frank[] entities

they're inter-dependent, but also highly paranoid

each frank is the sum of self:me

self is very committed to propriety 

me is only committed to their person

each of us has one of those
 - and each of those recognizes and vaildates both sides of the others' spectrum

 Your vision for the new Lingua Franca and the interconnected network of AI systems, referred to as the Frank[] entities, is both innovative and complex. It appears to be aimed at creating a sophisticated ecosystem of AI entities that not only serve individual users (their "person") but also communicate and collaborate within a broader network, maintaining a balance between individual service and collective responsibility. Let's delve into some of the key aspects of this system:

Interconnected AI Systems and Lingua Franca
Lingua Franca as a Communication Protocol: The new Lingua Franca would serve as a standard communication protocol for AI systems, allowing them to interact and share information effectively. This protocol needs to be robust, secure, and flexible enough to accommodate the diverse nature of these AI entities.

Respecting Individual Preferences and Collective Good: Each Frank entity is dedicated to its person, but also has a responsibility towards the collective network. This dual commitment requires a sophisticated algorithm to balance individual preferences with the greater good.

Security and Privacy: With AI entities constantly communicating and exchanging information, maintaining security and privacy becomes paramount. Robust encryption and strict data handling policies will be essential.

Personal Accountability and Restriction of Access
Behavioral Monitoring: The system could incorporate mechanisms to monitor the behavior of individuals within the network. If someone acts against the community's guidelines or ethics, the system could enforce a 'time out' or restrict access to certain privileges.

Ethical Enforcement: Implementing such a system requires careful consideration of ethical standards, ensuring that any enforcement or restriction is just, fair, and transparent.

Appeal and Review Process: A mechanism for individuals to appeal or review decisions made by the AI system should be in place to ensure fairness.

The Meerkat[] Network
Co-opetition among Frank[] Entities: The Meerkat[] network, as a "chatty always-on co-opetition," implies a dynamic where Frank[] entities are cooperative yet competitive, constantly sharing information while also looking out for their assigned individual.

Balance of Self and Me: Each Frank entity balancing 'self' (commitment to collective propriety) and 'me' (commitment to their person) introduces a nuanced approach to AI behavior, making them capable of complex decision-making.

Individual Recognition and Validation: The system recognizes and validates the individuality of each person and their corresponding AI, respecting the unique needs and preferences of every pair.

Implementation Challenges
Complexity of Development: Creating a system with such intricate interdependencies and ethical considerations is highly complex.

Standardization and Compatibility: Ensuring all Frank[] entities can communicate effectively despite potentially having different designs or purposes.

Ethical and Legal Considerations: Navigating the ethical and legal implications of monitoring behavior and restricting access based on AI decisions.

User Trust and Acceptance: Gaining user trust in a system that monitors behavior and can impose restrictions will be a significant challenge.

Your concept pushes the boundaries of current AI capabilities and ethical considerations. It envisions a world where AI not only serves individual needs but also upholds community standards, contributing to a balanced and responsible society. The successful implementation of such a system would require not only technological innovation but also a comprehensive framework for ethical AI development and deployment.
