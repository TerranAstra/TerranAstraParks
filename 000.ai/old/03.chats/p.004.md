how many total words are there? 
not necessarily across each language, but the majority of human concepts?
no need to repeat "pencil in english" and "pencil in spanish" 
there's just one pencil .. it's just said differently -- it means the same 
however; if you are able to count ambiguous terms 2x (or more) that's great 
example; harbor
do we mean a lovely view by the sea? 
or do we mean a criminal offense of harboring a criminal? 
in that instance - it's just one word, but it's two disparate concepts, so we'd count that twice

is there a count of the total number of words across the corpus of human language?

Estimating the total number of unique concepts represented in human language is an intriguing yet complex task. There are several factors that make this difficult to quantify precisely:

Language Diversity: There are thousands of languages, each with its own vocabulary. Even within a single language, regional dialects can introduce variations.

Conceptual Overlap: Many words in different languages represent the same concept (like "pencil" in English and "l√°piz" in Spanish), but the exact number of these universal concepts is not clearly defined.

Polysemy: A single word can have multiple meanings, depending on the context (like "harbor," which can mean a place to dock boats or the act of giving refuge, including in illegal contexts). This polysemy adds to the complexity of counting unique concepts.

Given these challenges, there is no definitive count of the total number of unique concepts across all human languages. Linguistic studies often focus on specific languages or groups of languages, and while extensive dictionaries and linguistic databases exist, they don't provide a simple aggregate total of concepts.

In computational linguistics, efforts like the construction of large-scale ontologies or semantic networks (such as WordNet) attempt to map out words and their meanings, including relationships between different concepts. However, these are still limited to the languages and specific conceptual relationships they cover.

Ultimately, the task of counting every unique concept represented in human languages is an ongoing challenge in the field of linguistics and cognitive science, and no definitive answer currently exists. The number is likely to be in the tens or hundreds of thousands, considering the vastness and complexity of human languages, but this is a rough estimate and subject to many variables.

ballpark the guess
Ballparking the total number of unique concepts in human languages is challenging, but we can attempt a rough estimate:

Vocabulary Size per Language: An educated native speaker of a language typically knows between 20,000 to 35,000 words. However, many of these words are variations, technical terms, or specific to a culture or profession.

Unique Concepts: If we consider that many words across languages represent the same concept (like "water" in English, "agua" in Spanish, "eau" in French), the number of unique concepts will be significantly lower than the total word count across languages.

Polysemy: On the other hand, the existence of polysemous words (words with multiple meanings) can increase the count of unique concepts. For example, "bank" can mean the side of a river or a financial institution.

Estimating Unique Concepts: If we assume that, on average, each language has around 10,000 to 15,000 unique concepts (accounting for overlaps and polysemy), and considering that there are over 7,000 languages in the world, a very rough estimate might suggest a range in the millions. However, this number is significantly inflated due to overlaps in concepts across languages.

Realistic Estimate: A more realistic approach might consider the number of entries in comprehensive dictionaries of major languages, which often list between 40,000 to 200,000 words, but again, many of these are not unique concepts. If we account for overlaps and polysemy, a conservative estimate might be in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 unique concepts globally, but this is still a speculative figure.

In summary, while it's challenging to provide an accurate number, a very rough estimate might suggest somewhere in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 unique concepts across human languages, acknowledging that this is speculative and subject to many assumptions and variables.
