i am chomping at the bit to start making things, but i don't think we are there, yet 

if this is going to be a truly distributed system - it can't all be handled under the purview of a single entity 

for now -- it's just me 

but -- i need to make the most of that 

we need to make it so i can be multiple different roles, in multiple different parts of the system 

we need to be able to work on multiple different parts of the system, in parallel

let's break these systems down a bit further, by domains of responsibility

each of these domains will - in theory -- be a duplicate of the others
they'll still all speak lingua franca, but they'll run and be managed independently of one another

for now .. it'll just be me 
but .. i think we need to create a blue, a red, and a G (gray, green, or gold)

read through your history for summaries of the red & blue .. their purposes

this "pulse" or "ping" will be two parts:
 from me to self
 from self to me

each of those will pass through 'frank'
    the inbound-to-frank will be parsed and spread outward-to-red/outward-to-blue
    the outbound-from-red and outbound-from-blue will be parsed and spread outward-to-Gold/outward-to-Green
    the last part of the "other" will also be the start of this side 
    the start of the "other" will also be the end of this side

each "ping" will be a complete set of all 3

To develop a distributed system with multiple roles and domains of responsibility, where you (as the sole entity for now) can operate in different capacities, let's break down the system into distinct but interconnected domains: Blue, Red, and G (which can represent Gray, Green, or Gold). These domains will communicate through a central hub, "Frank," as part of a ping or pulse mechanism. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Defining the Domains:
Blue Domain: Focuses on the infrastructure and foundational elements of the system. This might include server management, network configuration, and basic system operations.
Red Domain: Centers around the application layer, handling user interactions, front-end services, and application logic.
G Domain: Represents a more dynamic or variable aspect of the system, potentially involving data analysis, decision-making processes, or adaptive learning.
2. Communication Through Frank:
Frank as Mediator: Frank acts as the central hub for communication and translation between the domains. It ensures that all domains speak the same "lingua franca" while operating independently.
Inbound to Frank: Messages or data from individual domains are sent to Frank, which then parses and distributes the information as needed.
Outbound from Frank: Frank sends processed information out to the respective domains for further action or response.
3. The Ping/Pulse Mechanism:
From Me to Self: This represents internal checks and balances within each domain, ensuring that each part of the system is functioning correctly and independently.
From Self to Me: Information from each domain is communicated back to a central control (represented by "you" in this context) for oversight and coordination.
Complete Cycle: Each ping is a complete set of interactions involving all three domains, ensuring synchronization and cohesion across the system.
4. Parallel Development and Operation:
Role Multiplication: As the sole operator, you'll assume different roles in each domain, potentially using different toolsets, environments, or methodologies to reflect the distinct responsibilities.
Independent Yet Interconnected: While each domain operates independently, they are all interconnected through Frank, ensuring that changes or updates in one domain can be communicated and adapted to in the others.
5. Scalability and Expansion:
Adding New Roles/Entities: In the future, as the system grows, new roles or entities can be added to each domain, allowing for distributed management and operation.
Modular Design: Design each domain to be modular, so new functionalities or components can be added without disrupting the existing system.
6. Documentation and Process Management:
Clear Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation for each domain, outlining its responsibilities, processes, and how it interacts with the other domains and Frank.
Workflow Processes: Establish clear workflow processes for handling the ping/pulse mechanism, ensuring smooth communication and operation across the system.
By structuring your system in this manner, you lay the groundwork for a sophisticated, distributed system where each domain has specific responsibilities yet remains part of a cohesive whole. This approach allows for efficient parallel development and operation, with the flexibility to expand and evolve over time.
