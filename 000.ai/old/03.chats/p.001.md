## IaC Tasks

we want to be able to generate the entire enterprise, from the ground up, on a cadence
whether that's a day, a week, or a month doesn't matter.. we just need to be able to re-do our entire enterprise, from the ground up, on a consistent and repeatable basis 

we want to have "common components"
and they need to align across all 3 providers

we want to be able to describe the components in "lingua franka"
and have the components be translated into the appropriate provider-specific language
 - not only "that language" but also "that version" of the language, an instruction set which will, itself, morph over time 

 to accomadate this, we need to be able to describe the components of a universal language system, able to adapt over time 

 we want to use this system, to describe this system, as soon as possible

 To achieve your goal of generating and re-deploying your entire enterprise infrastructure on a consistent and repeatable cadence using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), along with the requirements you've outlined, you will need a robust and flexible approach. Here's a plan to help you get started:

1. Choose an IaC Tool/Framework
Terraform: Widely used and supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) but is relatively easy to understand and aligns well with the concept of a universal language for infrastructure definition.
Pulumi: Another tool that allows you to define infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages (e.g., TypeScript, Python). This can be beneficial if your team is already familiar with these languages.
2. Define Common Components
Modules/Library: Create modules for common components that can be reused across different cloud providers. These modules should encapsulate common infrastructure elements like compute instances, networking components, storage, etc.
Version Control: Store these modules in a version-controlled repository, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.
3. Universal Language System (Lingua Franca)
Abstract Definitions: Develop a high-level, provider-agnostic language or schema to describe your infrastructure components. This could be a custom DSL (Domain Specific Language) or a simplified configuration format like YAML or JSON.
Translators: Implement a translation layer that converts these abstract definitions into provider-specific IaC code. This layer will handle the nuances of each cloud provider and the specific versions of their API/SDK.
4. Version Management
Translation Layer Adaptability: Ensure that your translation layer can adapt to changes in provider APIs and IaC tooling versions. This might involve versioning your abstract definitions and maintaining compatibility layers within your translators.
Continuous Updating: Regularly update the translation layer to support new features and changes in cloud provider APIs.
5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
Automated Pipelines: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of your infrastructure. These pipelines will use your IaC code to provision and manage infrastructure.
Testing and Validation: Include steps for testing and validating both the abstract definitions and the generated provider-specific IaC code.
6. Iterative Development
Early Use: Start using this system to deploy and manage a small portion of your infrastructure. Gradually expand as the system proves reliable and effective.
Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback mechanism to continually improve the abstract definitions, translation layer, and modules.
7. Documentation and Training
Clear Documentation: Document the entire process, from writing abstract definitions to deploying with the generated IaC code.
Team Training: Train your team on how to use this new system, focusing on writing abstract definitions and understanding the translation process.
By following these steps, you can create a system that allows for the rapid and repeatable deployment of your enterprise infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, with the flexibility to adapt to changes over time.
