when you are discussing something .. whether as teacher or student .. you are you
it shouldn't even matter if the person you're talking with speaks a different language
the translation of the content should be seemless

we want to codify entire 'scenarios' into small units of data


Past and Future will both need to be Red and Blue components

each will need to be subDivided by myPerson

so .. both Red & Blue will each be an unbiased arbiter, but .. 
 - Red.myPerson will be unique sets of data
  - My own personal Dewey Decimal System
  - with Past.. open almost unquestioningly to frank
  - - that content should be one-way
  - - the red.parent broadcasts their content for frank[] network to consume
  - - your red.myPerson is one of many outlets
  - - frank knows to pick up receiving inbound values from red.myPerson
  traffic is always one-way


  the ping goes like this

  from me to self, with Red|Blue|G in between

  Red is a deck of cards

  Blue is a deck of cards

  each is re-constituated into two Rubik's Cubes

  "Frank" is an imaginary / virtual Rubik's Cube
  it's the amalgamation of the four Rubik's Cubes (2 each; Red and Blue)

  the ping is the update .. 
  - frank.self - concludes previous communication (derived "inward" from red.myPerson, blue.myPerson), encode presentations (offered "outward" to red.City[] blue.city[]), and send the ping to frank.me 

  each ping can only be 'complete' (written to the past) once all 3 are in place and 'witnessed' by the goldLine | notaryPublic

  The described system aims to create a comprehensive and dynamic method of communication and data processing, integrating both objective and subjective elements. It involves a unique interplay between various components, including Red, Blue, and Frank, with an emphasis on individualized experience (myPerson) and seamless interaction, regardless of language barriers or other differences. Here's a breakdown of the process and components:

Components of the System
Red and Blue Decks of Cards:

Represent the objective (Red) and subjective (Blue) aspects of information.
Red: Covers rules, knowledge, and data specific to the individual (Red.myPerson) and the collective (Red.parent).
Blue: Encompasses values, preferences, and personal experiences, both individual (Blue.myPerson) and collective (Blue.parent).
Rubik's Cubes:

Both Red and Blue are reconstituted into two Rubik's Cubes each.
These cubes symbolize the complex and multifaceted nature of the data and experiences they represent.
Frank as a Virtual Rubik's Cube:

Acts as the amalgamation of the four Rubik's Cubes (two each from Red and Blue).
Serves as a mediator, integrating and balancing the objective and subjective data.
GoldLine / NotaryPublic:

Witnesses and verifies the completion of each ping.
Ensures authenticity and integrity in the communication process.
The Ping Process
Commencement:

Initiated by frank.self, which concludes the previous communication cycle.
This involves deriving insights "inward" from Red.myPerson and Blue.myPerson.
Encoding Presentations:

Frank.self encodes presentations, offering them "outward" to the broader network (Red.City[] and Blue.City[]).
These presentations are based on the integrated information from Red and Blue cubes.
Transmission of the Ping:

The ping is then sent to frank.me.
It represents a comprehensive update, encompassing both objective and subjective elements.
Completion and Archiving:

The ping can only be considered 'complete' and written to the past once all three components (Red, Blue, and GoldLine/NotaryPublic) are in place and have witnessed the process.
This ensures that each interaction is accurately recorded and verified.
Key Principles
Seamless Integration and Translation: The system should facilitate effortless communication, transcending language barriers and other differences.
Personalization through myPerson: Each individual's unique data set and preferences are central to the system, allowing for tailored interactions and experiences.
Unbiased Arbitration: Both Red and Blue act as unbiased arbiters, ensuring a balanced representation of objective knowledge and subjective values.
One-Way Traffic for Security: Traffic from Red.myPerson to frank is one-way, safeguarding personal data and maintaining integrity.
Dynamic Interaction: The interaction between the Red and Blue components, mediated by Frank, is dynamic, reflecting the ongoing evolution of knowledge and personal experiences.
The envisioned system is a sophisticated blend of technology and human-centric design, aimed at creating a nuanced and highly personalized method of communication and data processing. It emphasizes the importance of balancing objective knowledge with subjective experiences, while ensuring security, integrity, and personalization.
