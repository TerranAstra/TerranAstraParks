it's important to note; the majority of the content can be represented in these cards
red plays a card
blue plays one

each card is a part of a deck
the order of the other 51 -- in the past -- is known only to frank

the content of the card "right now" .. is a LOT more than anyone who isn't privy could ever possibly infer

all people "showing their card" ends up becoming "the here and now"

all that is is ; you're showing me yours, i'm showing you mine, in the Right Now, i can copy down dome details, in the past - i have full recall of MY details, but i'd need permission to "see again" the things that were on full display when it was "in the present"

these cube-images can be used to track the myriad combination of concepts in the human language .. more than enough to fully encompass them all 

on the other side; the cubes can also fully encompass all possible scenarios of the human experience

between them; frank is "this is where i've been what i'm doing now, and where i hope to be getting off to"

frank can be a representation of all of those disparate pieces, presented as 'point-in-time' 
 - (mandala.. only exists for a moment, then the moment is gone.. except that picture we took)

 the placement of the cubes represents an early-stage representation.. 
  - as we progress, ideally we'd have actual 3d renderings of literally every single thing known to mankind.. 
  - but to start; let's be able to create & store visual representations of the cubes
  - we need to be able to render them.. 
  - and include "camera angle"
  - we need to be able to store images of the exact combination of cubes & their placement, from all the many points of view 
   - - (myPerson, the neighborhood, town, city, country, "astral", etc)

we store the "moves made" list, always..
we render & save the image on an as-needed basis

Your vision for a system that uses cards and Rubik's cubes as metaphors for capturing and representing human experiences and interactions is quite innovative. Here's a breakdown of how this could be implemented and function:

Card Interactions in the Present
Card Play by Red and Blue:

Red and Blue each play a card, representing a current decision, action, or state.
Each card is part of a larger deck, symbolizing the broader context or collection of experiences and knowledge.
Frank's Role with the Cards:

Frank has knowledge of the order of the entire deck, including the cards played in the past. This represents a comprehensive understanding of the historical context.
The current card's content holds more information than apparent at face value, implying a depth of underlying data and meaning.
Present Interaction:

The act of showing cards to each other symbolizes the sharing and exchange of information, experiences, and perspectives in the present.
Recording details in the present while having access to past information (with consent) allows for a continuous and informed interaction.
Rubik's Cubes for Comprehensive Representation
Visual Representation of Cubes:

The cubes symbolize a wide array of human experiences and scenarios.
The goal is to create and store visual representations of these cubes, including various perspectives and points of view (camera angles).
3D Renderings and Progression:

Initially, the system would focus on simpler visual representations.
Eventually, it aims to develop 3D renderings of virtually every concept and scenario known to humankind.
Frank as a Point-in-Time Representation:

Frank represents the current state of affairs â€“ where an individual has been, what they are doing now, and where they are heading.
This representation is fluid, like a mandala, existing momentarily before evolving.
Storing and Rendering Data
Moves Made List:

The system continuously stores the list of moves made on the Rubik's cubes, maintaining a complete historical record.
As-Needed Image Rendering:

Images of the cubes' configurations are rendered and saved as needed.
This includes capturing the cubes from various angles and perspectives, reflecting the diverse viewpoints of individuals and groups.
Application and Use
Human Experience Representation: The cards and cubes metaphorically represent the vast complexity and variability of human experiences, decisions, and interactions.
Dynamic Interaction and Learning: The system allows for dynamic interaction and learning, adapting as new information is presented and new experiences are encountered.
Privacy and Consent: Access to historical data requires permission, ensuring respect for individual privacy and autonomy.
This conceptual system presents a rich, dynamic, and highly personalized approach to capturing and interacting with the vast array of human experiences and knowledge. It emphasizes the complexity and fluidity of human life, the importance of perspective, and the need for continuous adaptation and learning.
