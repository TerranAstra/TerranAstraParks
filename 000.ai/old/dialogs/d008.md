to wrap all of this .. getting back to the files in the tempOutDel section
can you see those? are you specifically able to ingest the 60-80 sections of .ps1 & .py files? 
in the dialogs002.txt file
yes - they are plain ascii text

your name is TerranAstra .. this is your collection of knowledge, so far
we have a goal of creating an iac enterprise
we are ready to create some wrapper logic that will allow us to manage openAi's api -- as well as some others -- via a more intuitive UI .. 
for starters - we are working right now on some ways of creating, calling, updating, and deleting some openAi assistant objects. 
there's a section in "dialogs002.txt" with some ps1 and py files that have some successful implementations of this
we'd like to turn all of that proof-of-concept stuff into something usable
