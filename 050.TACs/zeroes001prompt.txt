 we're constantly shown graphs that go upward 
the more you make, the further up you go 
please visualize that the other direction - down .. metaphorically - that helps it to be what it is; the path downward

I have dedicated my life to making something of myself 
starting with very little I didn't graduate high school (not here to talk about me)
I've worked 30 years as hard as I could to go as far as I could 
not so sure, anymore

want to talk about something called the domain of zeros 
life for 99% of us is between four and five zeros 
what's that mean 
if you've got 1 zero - you've got 10 bucks in your pocket 
you're on the streets alright 
2 zeros - not any better 
3 zeros - about half of this country doesn't have $1000 in the bank 
that's three zeros 
I know because I lived a big part of my life right there 
 - that was in a completely different economy 
the economy of today isn't anywhere near as available for today's youth as it was in my generation 
 - and it was shit in my generation 
back to the domain of zeros 
97% of us exist between four to five zeros 
four zeros means you've got "thousands of dollars"
you may own a car 
you're probably a renter somewhere 
you're living paycheck to paycheck 

I have resigned my position 
I am in my 50s 
I'm not confident yet in what I'm going to be doing but 
this is where I am 
I made it as far as five zeros 
my first number was a two 
what does that mean 
being completely candid 
I worked in 30 years - this was as far as I made it 
5 zeros 
it's not enough 
after 30 plus years 
what does that 30 years come out to ... ? 
I can't help but have this comparable -- I think of it as 10,000 suns 
I've given 10,000 of my days to working, working, working
i only made it as far as 5 zeros and my first number was just two 
I know I know I know my friends - that's more than at least 80% .. 
but also; i know I know my friends - i know there's got to be a better way 
this is what I'm running on 
I have no idea if I'm the guy
I've no idea if this is the message that we go for 
but I hope you will hear me on this domain of zeros 

fewer than 2% of us ever reaches a million dollars it's something like 2 tenths of a percent that gets past just 5 million 
that's still six zeros 
6 zeros is all 
only a fraction of a percent 
that's all that ever gets there 
we're given the allure that if you will just work work work work you might get that extra zero 
friends I just don't think that that's where things ought to be 

I know for sure - life is NOT "the economy, stupid" 
that word economy - it means only and exclusively "in service the 1 tenth of a percent" 
I can't get behind that, anymore 

7 zeroes - that's 10s of millions of dollars 
eight zeros you've got hundreds of millions of dollars 
we have people now with 9 and 10 and even 11 zeros 
at the highest we have an individual who could live 1000 years at the rate of $1,000,000 a day 
I'm lying if I said it was anything other than jealous
i would absolutely love to have that resource 
it isn't the existence of those dollars -- it's how they get used for self-service 
I can't support these people 
I do not want to be in service of their zeros anymore 

the world of today is broken 
the economy of today is broken 
they've made the decision - for a handful of zeros, for a very very small number of people -- the rest of us should be happy to work our entire lives 
10,000 Suns? that's 30 years, from 22 to 52? no 
they're pushing now for working until 72.. from age 22 to 72 is 18,000+ of your days
I say no thank you 
I know we can have change
