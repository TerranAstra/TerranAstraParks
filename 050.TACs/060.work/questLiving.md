### Quest Life

10-20%  have never seen the ocean .. i think that's low
many have never been more that 20 miles form home
we all want to learn a musiccal instrument
or a foriegn language

we live in a world of punishments.. very few 'rewards' .. zero 'hey reach for this' 
i want something for people to reach  for .. 
i want you to achhieve this

cannot promise *much.. 
but what if i say they're worth 2-3 bucks a month / 20 years
first few quests? that's nothing, sure

stick with that.. 
by simply "living your best life" .. i will fkn PAY YOU

i think we are all angry .. maybe this offers some psychological balance .. 'something to look forward to' is key to that 
i want this system for the kid i *was at 17.. he had nothing, deserved a lot more
i create this from the pov of 'what kind of leadership would i *want??'
as opposed to existing leaders, many of whom seem psychotically hell-bent on using their position to aggravate "them"
i hate the music scene of today.. fk yeah i want to pay out a few million to get some instruments into a vastly expanded pool of potential players
