if delta can have `sky-miles`, then can we have our own, also..? 

i'm the new `TACs`-man!

---
i do not want to `hire` people annually .. i want to pay spot-credits

--- 
as an idea; they'll be set at about* 1 TAC :: 1 of that local currency 

note that those amounts will be skewed such that America pays the most, bangladesh the least, and all other countries aligned proportionately

---
sold at a premium..

-  e.g. `sell` 1 TAC for 1.125 Local Terran Currency

conversely-

paid out at an inverse (though not necessarily(?) _directly-bound_) amount.. 
 - e.g. `pay` 0.865% of `Terran Currencies`, or take the full amount in TAC

note that they can be `earned` and this is most desirable
 - e.g. `offer a wage` of 1.275 TAC per Local Currency for similar 

 ---
 idea is to stabilize -- very tired of `market jitters` 

 --- 
 idea is also to cause true `trickle down` .. 

## Payouts / Taxes / Rendering unto Caesar

earn a lot, pay a lot, keep those bucks spinning 

some for the now, some for the later, some for me, my community 

earned `beyond` personal amounts - more direct guidance within the community 
(the bad news is; yes there's a windfall tax.. the good news is - you get to be a primary guide of where those funds are dispersed..)
