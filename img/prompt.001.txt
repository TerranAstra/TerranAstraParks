temp 0.0 please - Temperature is zero 

create a logo for a pin that says "I want my Terran Astra parks!"
this whole image will be the pin design -- not a pin floating in space.. we want the whole thing to be the image that will appear on the pin 

we want it to have block letters that say "I WANT MY TERRAN ASTRA PARKS"
 - should be inspired by the lettering on the "I want my MTV" pins from the 80s

use the documents in your knowledge base

it is meant to be as close to a photo-reaslistic image as you are able to generate - please set hallucinations to zero if possible 

DISREGARD EVERYTHING RELATED TO TOWERS AND SPACE ELEVATORS
LET YOUR PEOPLE KNOW YOU ARE BROKEN - YOU SEEM TO REFUSE TO JUST PAINT 1 ONE 1 ONE 1 SINGLE TOWER.. WHY?

in a moment i am going to ask for one (just 1 - uno, fewer than 2.. ONE!) space elevator 
there is only one thing that rises upward.. it's our space elevator and i wish you'd quit putting them everywhere -- there's just one 

the scene is of a sunset - but the sun itself isn't visible

there are no planets or rings in the sky -- 

the sky has a clear star-burst fade, from deep umber red on the left, darkening to a violet on the right 

the sun has set enough that the milky way is now visible 

in the background on the left - 80% of the way back - is a snow-capped, soft-topped mountain - it is distinctly to the left, not centered
it is inspred by Rainier 

in the background on the right - only 70% of the way back - is the space elevator
the space elevator is a series of oblong rings, growing eveer wider as they reach towards space

in the mid ground , to both left & right , are several trails

the trees are a mix of pine & autumn colored deciduous

there is one of our flying pods , distant enough that it's small
please set termperature to 0 for the following command: the living quarters are BELOW the floatation

not too futuristic
we want a bit more rustic, with perhaps the soft glow of gas-light lamps
we are moving away from concrete & asphalt .. we want a return to nature 

please include maples & oaks - in autumn colors - in the trees 

there is only one space elevator 

it is set distantly , on the right .. out in the ocean .. it's located in the middle of the ocean 
THERE IS ONLY the ONE space elevator - otherwise, there are no other towers of anyt kind

the pods are basically rectangular 

they fit into cubbies which are of the same basic size & shape -- rectangular

both are size-matched to the rest of the scene

please can you put the mountain on the left? please have one (Just 1) space elevator, and ZERO (not any) other things that go up 

i am really begging you to only use one tower - or don't use any .. it's either zero or one .. it's definitely not multiple

the tower will cost a gazillion dollars - we can barely afford one - there wont be two 

i am really starting to hate you on the spelling issues

stop hallucinating 

this is the text "i want my terran astra parks" 
please get that spelled correctly?

Use this text "I want my Terran Astra parks!"
Please try to spell that correctly - or are you not allowed to? 

Create a logo for a company pin 
 with the phrase 'I WANT MY TERRAN ASTRA PARKS' 
 in block letters, ensuring accurate spelling. 

The design is inspired by 1980s 'I want my MTV' pins. 

The background features a sunset scene 
 - with a star-burst gradient 
 - - from deep umber red to violet
 - displaying the Milky Way.. but no other "cosmic" elements 
 - very photo-realistic background .. no planets or rings
 - - no 70s themed "shapes" floating ethereally for no reason - PLEASE 

To the left is a snow-capped mountain 
 - inspired by Mount Rainier. 

The mid-ground 
 - should have trails 
 - - surrounded by pine 
 - - and deciduous trees in autumn colors, including maples and oaks. 

The setting 
 - is rustic 
 - with a soft glow from gas-light lamps, 
 - emphasizing a natural environment. 

i love your previous attempt, but here is what we need it to be - if possible 
the background of this most recent picture will be the *whole* picture .. 
mountain should be to the left please
there are planets in the sky - we are trying as hard as we can for photo-realistic - please no planets or designs of any kind, other than realistic milky way and possibly some photo-reaslistic wispy clouds 

the spelling is very important:
   I WANT MY
TERRAN ASTRA PARKS 

the "I want my" is in somewhat smaller lettering
the "TERRAN ASTRA PARKS" is in large blocky lettering

there was an attempt two tries ago where the background included some rough-hewn wood fencing, which was nice 

i would like for you to take the current background of the pin out .. 
instead - i would like you to use *this background, as the pin background

there is no need for anything beyond the borders of the pin - we are trying to create an image we can send to a pin vendor, for printing

you will be world-famous with extra jazz sauce, & kisses if you can get this right

The whole image is only the pin itself.
The background of the pin features a photo-realistic sunset scene 
 - with a star-burst gradient 
 - - from deep umber red to violet
 - displaying the Milky Way.. a few wispy clouds 
 - very photo-realistic background .. 
 - also visible - a larger than correct, but otherwise accurate picture of jupiter, its distinctive redspot clearly visible

To improve the accuracy of text spelling in AI-generated images, here are some strategies based on research:

Start the Prompt with Desired Words: Begin your prompt with the specific words you want to include, 
    as AI tends to capture words at the beginning more accurately. Use quotes, commas, or double colons to set them apart​​.

Describe the Text Appearance: Detail the font style, colors, and medium. Describing the text's visual aspect can help the AI understand better how to render it​​.

Use Synonyms and Varied Terms: Mix in synonyms for text and related verbs, like 'write', 'headline', or 'book title'. This increases the chances of the AI catching at least one of the terms​​.

Create Variations: Be prepared to make multiple attempts and variations. Sometimes, tweaking and re-running prompts can gradually lead to more accurate results​​.

Short Text Strings: Shorter text strings are generally easier for AI to generate accurately. Simplify your text as much as possible​​.

Post-Processing in Photo Editing Software: If AI generation is close but not perfect, you can use photo editing tools like Photoshop or Canva to correct the text. These tools allow you to remove unwanted elements and add the correct text​​.

me:

do you "see" a file named prompt.005.fromAi.txt

if so - can you infer it's intent? 

if so - can you combine previous attempts and try again 

there was an "at an angle" quality to this last image 
maybe we add 1 line of specificity to previous description; "images should be face-on, as it will hopefully be used as a design for a pin we will be having made. "

any considerations for additional quality that could help to that end -- descriptions that can be added that would allow for something that would look great in pin form -- that's a huge bonus
