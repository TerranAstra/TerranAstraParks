i am running for president, on the biggest story i've ever heard

### Plans: 

## endOfUnemployment
i have an idea for eradication of the word "unemployment" .. i don't mean crap jobs - quality of life stuff, with a "piggy bank" style approach to pay now & later, as a part-time job for all americans, not for any corporation, in a "dude-ranch" style "earn a vacation, even if you can't afford one" vacations for all model

i have an idea for infinite energy from the sun, the sea, and even firewood.. i can create millions of tons of firewood - while never harming a single forest

## 

my software system will serve only as an intermediary / arbiter / standards-setter / regulations, receipts / cahier-style work, all from a novel approach i'd like to explore to the concept of a hive-mind

i ultimately want to create an entire "infrastructure of up" - a global network of buses the size of cruise ships that never land.. 
given their size, and the fact that they'll be over all of the nations and we can't all be shooting them down, we need 2 globally agreed-upon ruleSets:
 - LinguaFranca: a new lingua franca, that is a combination of all the languages of the world, not "translation after the fact" .. a neutral translator - completely unaware of who those translations are for 
 - GrayLine: a global air traffic control system, that is a combination of all the air traffic control terminals, hopefully installed in dmz all over.. we never reach space if all nations continue at these levels of hostilities..

i'd like to establish a series of parks, in communities. they can be places you can go to 
 - "spend" money: buy meals, rides, and experiences, something i call questLiving*
 - "earn" money: work, experience new roles, and learn new skills
 - "save" money: half the pay is "credits for now" w a 333 day expiration
    - "invest" money: the other half is "credits for later" w a 240 month allocation/conversion into "now" credits

TACs - Terran Astra Credits

## the story of me
in an interesting twist -- i was dead! died several times at birth.. not a "zombie", the terms are: revenant / lich
i came from welfare on both sides
i have extreme adhd - if we talk, youll see that.. cant keep lasting connections
at 14 .. i experienced something i can't explain.. i am a "devout agnostic" .. i have a mind for science. i never proseltyze, but also i insist on respect 
out of the house at 17 - i technically didn't even graduate
by then i was clearly a sociopath.. functioning.. but shattered
despite that -- sat myself down at 20 and created a self-guided system of training computers - this was before the pc revolution started 
 i knew 2 things ; life was never going to "happen to me" and computers were the future 
at 22 - outsold store / nearly  south-east on this contest .. that factors in, later.. 
weeks later - quit the job.. who quits??? "best fkn salesperson ever".. i did.. long story
at 30 - i had a 2nd odd experience
i think i have some plans that are bigger than me
i just want to explore them, but it feels important.. like - they shouldn't be risked coming into fruitoion, unless it can also be guaranteed that they can go directly into a "this will be for the people of earth, forevermore, never a man, a company, a country, a power lust, a wealth lust.. "
