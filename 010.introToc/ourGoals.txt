we want to incorporate a vast (and growing) number of goals

several of these goals have inter-dependencies

we want to create an app called 'eyeContact'
 - our 'heroes' were men like stephen hawking & christopher reeve
 - we want to create a 'virtual' eyeContact for myPerson, no matter who they are
 - using eyeContact alone, myPerson should be able to scan the entire screen, and interact with any item on the screen

we want another called the blackBox
 - similar to the blackBox on an airplane, we want to store a 5-15 second recording of everything 
 - - a problem we are solving can be seen w today's "smart devices" .. say their name, wait the requisite 2 seconds, then ask your question
 - for ours - we don't want that.. in fact; if the person says their thing ~and then~ remembers to say franks's name -- that should still work fine
 - because when frank hears his name ex-post-facto (e.g. "hey, what's the weather like, franks??") - that oughtta work just fine

 we want blackBox to be always listening, but not always sending
  - a few key contexts ougght to be have the ability to auto-send .. for instance - if the person says "call 911" - that should be sent immediately, no need for names, no need for eyeContact

we want to create a virtual meetingSpace
 - frank *is* a meeting.. a "meeting in progress".. 
 - when you (a human being) join this meeting, your shadowOfFrank joins this meeting
 - the meeting will be desiged to match life
 - - there is an ongoing meeting, with or without you.. where Time meets Space (which is everywhere) is the proverbial tree falling in the lonely woods
 - - BUT .. that spot where one single instance of myPerson is overlapped to the spot of timeMeetsSpace... that's our platinumVector, TM

platinumVector:
 - there are 8 billion people
 - there are infinitely more places than 8bn
 - there are an equally infinite number of timeSpaces (>8bn)
 - - BUT - only ONE person can occupy that timeSpace
 - - AND - each person can be in only one timeSpace
 - - AND - each Time and each Space can be tracked independently
 - - - space by franksKeySide
 - - - time by franksTimeSide
 - - it goes without saying - each person is tracked independently 
 - - - myPerson is tracked by the gLine
 - the resulting 3partVector is called our platinumVector
