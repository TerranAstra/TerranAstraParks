Bill of Responsibilities –"Astral 'Constitution*'"*Again –need a better / different word
•With Rights –I feel –come responsibilities
•Many people use phrase "rights" as both sword & shield•there is nothing whatsoever anyone can do to induce a mind -change
•But; that's not the path to my inner group. Again –it's easy for Americans to scream their indignation. How dare me?? But I honestly want to approach all of this from the point of view of "we are on airships that never land, instead they circumnavigate the entire planet, over every country, and we don't want to get shot down" , so.. This dialog seems worth being where we "start from" not where we "get to"
•With rights -- especially when those rights are being exercised by people in positions of power & influence, or involve personal safety and the power to kill -- come great responsibility. That should be self-evident.
•1st -  Boy Who Cried Wolf -> Put Up or Shut Up
•2nd -  Can't Get my Guns -> mini versions of Kim Jong Un & vice versa be clear about why examples explain responsibilities
•* Flying Cars seems like a pretty awesome buy-back offer...
•I truly don't see how humanity moves forward without that simple thing that says; "you have responsibilities"
•File this under the "About Me"...?I am not just "starting a company"

- i want to spend a portion of each day, leading up to the election, answering "fan mail"*
 - by fan mail; i mean anything from the right addressed to the folks who are "godless"
 - i also mean anything from the left, adressed to "white men/people" | "stright/cis/binary"
