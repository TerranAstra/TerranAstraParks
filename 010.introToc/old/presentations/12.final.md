•With all that divides people in this country .. very little that unites us
•One of the only 'safe' topics is sports
•I have no use for sport-Ball
•I can't stand the phrase  "YOUR LOCAL  SPORTSBALL  TEAM!"
•I don't have one of those.  Nor any interest, thanks.
•that and "end-stage capitalism"
•I also have zero  use for "NEXT YEAR'S MODEL LINEUP" - for ANY vehicle
•and less interest still in "coming soon" signs. 
•Is that really it? Is that really all we've got to look forward to?
•If we do this –you will have "YOUR Terran  Astra Park"
•Yes.. It'll pay you..
•things  that divide  have become larger than  anything  that unites
•I hope to bring something we can all believe in
•and something we can all "work" together towards
•But –even "work" has become something  many of us dread ..
•we will need to do better, if we are to get into space
•I want these jobs to be the most exciting in the world ..
•I want them to pay in Park Rewards
•60% of the trips to the space elevator are earned, only through work 
•NOT by virtue of wealth!
•Tell me that "Trips into Space" wouldn't be a better  incentive  than 
"I'm the jobs president"
•Biden  recently visited  a United  Auto Worker plant
•Hi, Joe
•I respect that?.. Kinda..?
•My "Bridge to Business" approach will be better
•whether that's just part-time work for any given company's people
•or partnering with food, transpx, hotel, & entertmx industries
•"Vacations through Terran Astra Parks" will make a great incentive for all kinds 
of companies
•I want to build  partnerships  with all kinds  of companies
•2 rules of partnership with me
•they're  both "do the right thing"
•1- pay your taxes (no havens)
•some of you might have the odd slip-up, I know
•look forward to partnering all of you
•right after aforementioned slip-ups get corrected
•2- pay your people
•If this 2nd thing was in place –there wouldn't be a need for a strike
•Neither of those 2 should –ostensibly –even be a thing in need of mention
•But .. here we are
•Instead; I want to find incentives ..
•ex: companies' management can only get credits through the companies they 
represent
•Or - put another way
•If you don't pay the people on the picket line, you can't have the mansion on the 
mountain
•C'mon –That's a little better than "I walked the picket line with 'em"
•I mean –for all parties concerned, right??
•Bye, Joe
•I also won't have any advertising  on my platform
•paid taxes? paid people? You're fully advertised, with me
•On an even larger scale - I really hope I can get other leaders  of the 
world to see
•this ice-Halo design is arguably the best overall answer for global warming
•if we had this network of buses, each w ~50k gallons of water ballast  - what 
would that do for the fires in Hawaii & island of Greece ?
•for that matter -- what would change if we have 1/2bn gallons or so of water, 
available in the skies??
•I don't think  that was the last of the wildfires 
•These messages don't effectively convey how well I feel this infrastructure 
could represent a LOT of relief
•the ice halo on a global warming scale
•and the water ballast for more focused fire-fighting
•One last consideration.. (If 'president'  ever happened .. )
•I only want these  parks long enough  to build  the flying  cars
•then they belong*** to the community ("belong***")
•Definitely going to keep a few rules in place for them, even after turned-over
•we can practice the monetary system - during that 4 year period
•Point is; I am 100% OK w most (not all, but nearly) of the earnings 
going into a general fund  during  the entire 4 years ..
•Discuss conditions candidly
•Your mileage will vary, etc.
•If there was progression  to this  story of "Up & Away"
•Level 4 - Top - add a "global story" to this story .. something like war of the 
worlds - something for the whole world to get behind
•Level 3 - huge w space elevator & a regular vacations into space
•Level 2 - mid-size company, w buses all oer world
•Level 1 - small business, a couple dozen parks few thousand flying RVs
•Flying  cars, space elevators,  parks that pay us, earning  vacations?
•all that and we are going to peel back the veil of time??
•I like this story ..
•I think we can do big things with this story
•I hope we can get started on this new story .. soon
•in fact - I know exactly  how we can get started.  Right now ..
•step 1 .. look away
•Everybody
•De-exist that guy
•Life.Next awaits
•you don't need to retweet, copy & paste, watch videos, forward videos
•That emperor never had clothes. Don't do his free advertising anymore
•not just the news. Folks in the trenches are forwarding his every word, 
obsessively
•Can we all please talk about flying cars, now ??
•I am SO done with all the rest of it ..
