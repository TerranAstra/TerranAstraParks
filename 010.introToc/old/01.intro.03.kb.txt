i am / i'm running

why am i doing this?
we 'can do better and we 'need to do better, and soon
not 'angry, but more than 'disappointed
 - *disgusted
these are our only choices? 
old guy who'll shit all over half of the country? 
 - *but, only *one of these is a potential threat to democracy, america, & humanity

why me?
i'm not nice, not here to pretend. i want change. that's all i'm promising
i have always stood up for the little guy. i am here for the young people.
*i LOVE my ideas
- flying car infrstructure
- tackling global warming (x2)
- a complete end to the word 'unemployment'
- vacations for everyone
a whole host of possibilities that i'd love to explore
i believe there can be more than this
but we'll need to work together

who am i?
nobody
poor both sides (so many of us are)
can't just sit by, when i KNOW we can bring change

let me hear from you
