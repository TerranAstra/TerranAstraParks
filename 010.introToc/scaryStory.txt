will you help me write something scary?
my goal is to unify people 
humanity is constantly at war with itself

am i a fool to believe that if we all believed that we shared a common threat, that we could unite and work together to overcome it?

i want to write a story that will scare people into believing that we are all in this together

something that will make people realize that we are all human
something like  "War of the Worlds" or "Independence Day", but .. we approach it from the beginning as;
     "hey -- we are going to tell a story, like the old WWF wrestling days .. "
     "we know it's not real, but.. so what?? "
     "let's start a team called "DEFCON-4" .. we want humanity's best and brightest to join us in this effort .."
     "save humanity from .. some nebulous 'threat from outer space'"
which is something we will need to dream up
