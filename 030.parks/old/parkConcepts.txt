place to call your own
place to 'go' / be
place(s) to work in short term
your own place - long term work (the only 'investment' there is)
thousands of them, tens, hundreds, or thousands of acres each
they pay you, regardless
'dude ranch' - i don't care how poor you are, get in here

hybrid of 
 - national parks | we will have *some capitalism
 - amusement parks | not that much, dial back asphalt, concrete, chachkis
 - restaurants | except out in nature
 - parks of today | manicured / dressed out / themed up
