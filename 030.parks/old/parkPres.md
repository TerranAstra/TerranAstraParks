Terran Astra Parks 
There is far too much to all of this for this Kick-Starter blurb. For the whole story, CLICK HERE 
What we want to create 
•Hybrid/combo of Parks/Restaurants/Amusement Parks 
o Enjoy what we think of today as “parks” – nature, complete with great views of 
sunrises/sunsets, populated with plants/trees with flowers/fruit/nuts; explore a 
beautiful place/scenery 
o Dine in leased cooking & coffee spaces, public and private, served by rotating existing 
restaurants, entrepreneurs, and/or individuals wanting to try their hand at the grill 
o Ride throughout park in pod-based mobility units on pre-determined paths for 
enjoyment or as a place for completing remote work 
o Experience hands on activities – provide resources (e.g., physical space, SMEs, tools) to 
explore hobbies, learn skills, create music with others 
o Contribute to tasks necessary to build and/or maintain properties and “earn” credits 
toward future visits (and first options for purchasing an early version of a flying car) 
How we plan to create it 
•Identify and acquire available plots of land accessible to moderate to large size cities but with 
desirable features (e.g., lakes & rivers, mountains) 
•Build and test blueprints for small versus large-sized properties 
•Harness volunteer workers who earn credits by completing agricultural (e.g., planting trees), 
creative (e.g., offering guitar lessons) or culinary (e.g., running a food truck) projects 
How to share/implement the park experience 
•Expand footprint by implementing blueprints from prototype parks to communities throughout 
the US 
•Work with local businesses to identify and provide the right/unique hands-on activities and 
dining experiences for each park 
•Work in partnership with local employers to leverage pod-based mobility units as functional 
office space 
•Craft program for offering “vacations” in the park to under-served populations
