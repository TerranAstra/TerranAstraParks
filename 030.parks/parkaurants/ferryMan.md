Introduction 
 
Goals:  
 
Build a better system for nearly everything; cars & transportation, yes. But also; airlines & airports, 
housing, cruise ships, vacations, ground-living vs. arable land, day-to-day work 
Today’s family cars all have their own chassis, tires, engine, steering wheel, and the responsibility that 
comes with it all (gas, regular maintenance, insurance, chance of killing or dying) 
None of us needs to own anything more than our own “personal space” 
We are all chauffeured (nobody will ever use this system for spying, jihad, stunts, etc.)  
We also get privacy which will never come with any existing form of public Transporation 
Most Importantly – all other forms of transportation seem focused on “Getting from Point A to Point B”. 
In this case – there may not even be a destination other than the journey itself. Meaning – people may 
just want to ride around in their space, while “Up”. This could feasibly be a new in-demand housing 
market.  
Personal Space 
 
We all hate the idea of “the wet spot” on public transportation 
Ranging in size from small, to medium, to large enough to be an efficiency, for instance if you wanted a 
home in the skies...  
 
Small – Single-Seater 
2 * 3 (Yards / Meters) = 62 
Big enough for a comfy chair and some personal storage. Imagine one of today’s tiny 3-cylinder cars, but 
no need for engine, wheels, etc. Just the chair, storage. Possibly AC & Speakers...? 
Small enough to store 6 or 8 in an average parking space of today’s parking garages 
Able to dock for indeterminate periods of time at the park 
Medium – Four-Seater 
4 * 6 = 242 
Picture a dining table or the back of an executive limousine. Enough room for 4 average sized adults 
Large – Meeting Space or RV / Efficiency 
8 * 12 to 12 * 20 = 1002 to 2002.  
Picture a floating RV or efficiency apartment. Ideally, these would be inexpensive enough that we could 
all have 3 or 4 of them, situated around various cities 
Note that an RV could possibly be set to hold 2 to 4 “nested” single seaters. 
Lifting Unit 
 
“Chassis” 
“Lift-able” frame Unit 
Extensible (KB: Maybe you mean expandible?) – should have a few “widths” (4, 8, 12 feet spans) which 
can be strung along in a chain that can be as long as needed – a dozen or so for a single-seater, possibly 
a hundred for a family RV 
Drone “sections” 
Add & remove units. For a single seat; may only need a dozen or so. For a family of four, we may want 
60 or 80, with luggage. 2-300 for RV (or “Speed Racing”). Each drone section can be fitted to a unit from 
the chassis 
(KB: Maybe move this section to “Batteries”? There is some duplication with text below, though.) Most 
flying car ideas of the day seem to have “flight time” as a consideration. Meaning – batteries seem to 
have 15-20 minute life spans and go 30-50 miles. We don’t need any of that. We just need to go up 2-3 
miles, approximately 12,000 feet (3-5 Km)  
Batteries 
Seems most of the attempts at flying cars are fixated on going 15-20 miles, in 15-20 minutes. 
Consequently, batteries end up being more than half of the weight of the whole 
We only need enough juice to go about 15-20,000 feet. Enough to get up 
The “Bus” - Personal, Local, or Express 
 
Small – Personal Bus 
Think “Flying RV” or “Yacht”, even 
Able to land anywhere that campers are allowed – and hopefully more 
 
Medium – Express Bus – a quick (relatively) means of getting from city to city 
Think “Airplane replacement” 
 
Large – “Local” Bus – spinning in large circles, around major cities 
Trace circular patterns around their home-city 
Multiple units, for larger cities – your next bus will be along, shortly 
Bus Design 
 
KB: Insert thoughts about redundancy 
 
Hex Balloon 
(KB: Maybe insert picture here?) 
Constructed of carbon fiber 
Constantly being refilled by a slow run of pure hydrogen from the top 
Constantly venting out from the bottom 
Designed to form a “well” near the bottom, such that any heavier gases which may leech in, can be 
expelled on an on-going basis 
 
Balloon “Segment” 
(KB: I definitely will need a picture here since I am having difficulty conjuring what this looks like) 7 per 
layer, with 3 layers, all uniquely encased, in sections of 18* 
Some segments may have “hardware” at the center 
• Batteries 
• Heating elements 
• Propulsion 
 
Super Structure 
A giant “surfboard” 
“Local” Bus – 2 “Sandwiched” layers of the 3-layer design of balloons, for the larger stationary buses 
Has a suspended “Cruise Ship” for each 
Larger city buses may have an additional open layer above the living quarters, as a “park” 
Solar, Batteries, & Electrolysis 
 
Solar 
Entire top of the bus will be paneled over with solar panels 
Batteries 
There will be a need for “standardized” batteries 
Batteries themselves can be ferried back & forth to & from ground, as needed 
Electrolysis 
With any & all “spare power” - create surplus hydrogen for other types of businesses 
Safety Considerations 
Hydrogen 
We’ve all seen the Hindenburg. Seems that if they had never needed to land, that this disaster could’ve 
been averted. if a landing was inevitable – steps could’ve been taken to ensure that the polarity & 
charge of the structure matched the ground, to avoid electrical arcing. Our boats will never land. If a 
landing is unavoidable – their charge will exactly match the ambient charge of the ground below it 
Lifeboats - “Overboard!” 
Need “instant response” in the form of life-vest detection. A device that can instantly (or nearly so) 
launch itself. On a trajectory to place itself between person & ground 
Should take at most 5-10 seconds to activate, 15-20 seconds to be under the person (“Down-power”), 
and 20-30 seconds to slow to a non-lethal impact speed 
Super Structure 
To the maximum extent possible – no oxygen. Entire structure will be flooded with Nitrogen, on an on-
going basis. All excess gases will be vented & funneled out through to the propulsion system 
Money-Making opportunities 
Transportation 
Energy 
Housing 
Entertainment 
LEU 
Military 
“Green” space 
Disaster Recovery 
Why rebuild ground dwellings that have been destroyed by fire, etc.?  
What happens when the Antarctic ice shelfs melt, and millions near the sea are displaced
