# "Park-aurants"? "Restau-parks"?

yes, the name sucks.. totally taking suggestions on better names 

a fusion of parks and restaurants... it's where you want to be, for eating, then working, then probably sleeping, too.. 

--- 
a fusion of parks & restaurants - not sure why we don't have these already, these seem very viable, regardless of whether or not anyone wants to contribute extra to "Up"

this is where we start .. we can fund our first park for "just a few million" .. more than most of us have ever dreamt of.. but a pittsance compared to what we would need for space-elevator 

we are tired of "Coming Soon!" signs.. there is nothing exciting on a coming soon sign. i do not want to see any more brick n mortar anything.. 

we sometimes* go to parks.. they're nice

we sometimes* go to places like Disney - there's only so much roller-coaster riding i want.. 

we go to too many* restaurants (if we're lucky, i guess... there's many for whom this luxury is unattainable).. when we are there; we sit at a table, surrounded by hundreds of others. we waited in line for this??

when we get to the Restaupark (at first) we get into a community booth. they're no different from the booths you sit in at restaurants, except these are going to be on the go (as a sustainer; we have the option of `buying` our own personal booth / [Personal Pod](https://github.com/TheseApps/TerranAstra-FlyingCars))

minimal signs of humanity, otherwise.. just you & yours, moving along 

first few minutes; bread / water / etc.

10-15 minutes later; moving by the restaurant 

paths through the park (30, 60, 90, 120 minute jaunts) 

criss-cross by lakes, rivers, waterfalls, hills, etc

`turn-outs`, some with flat-scapes, some for seclusion, some for socializing, some for extended-stay (if we reach a point where people `stay` on the parks)

---
'owned' & managed by that town, but peopled by the town's neighborhoods -- "rent" booth space -- if you feel like running a restaurant (or any other asset?) for a few weeks or months - the neighborhood pays & collects on your behalf
