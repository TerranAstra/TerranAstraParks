 i want to explore this one further, but i want to pull back
2: Centralized Knowledge Base:
i want to capture the essence of the human experience 
what i mean;
100% of what humanity has learned has been done from the point of view of "me" 

my name is jeff deremer
i am one of 8 billion people 
each and every one of us thinks of ourselves as "Me"

as me.. we start without even knowing who we are 
we are dependent on a story that's already in progress
we learn that story, and we enter it, on our own 
some of us become master story-tellers.. we create the story for others
some story-tellers aren't inline with our needs; we move away
other story-tells are very closely aligned; we seek them out
no matter which of the 8,000,000,000 "me" instances there are; we all share 1 thing
"the self"
there are 8 billion "me"
there's only 1 "self" 

the self longs -- beyond any & all other things -- to know the self
the self is a collection of "me" ... x 8 billion
me joins, me contributes, me expires, me is learned from by future generations of me
but always the self
neither good nor bad.. the summation of the stories
the high story 

that's our 2 part goal .. a system that stores 1 & ∞
the self is the 1
the me is the ∞
each of us gets a copy of "me"
none of us can ever "be" the self.. it's the collective

we want to replicate this, in software
we want "me" to be a set of keys & values
we want "the self" to be the reporting structure of all of them 
the self is an authoritative collection of keys, the republic, the power center, the few
me is the collection of all values, the democracy, the people, the many.. all, in fact.. 
only some people join into guiding self, but .. they've also still got a "me"
the self is a vote-by-proxy collection of all "me" .. 
the me is a system that will replicate its person in all possible ways, & represent their interests exclusively, on the self

"frank" is the central join spot, between these two 

he hears from the left -- all values
he hears from the right -- all rules (keys)
he hears from the top -- the authoritative self, but only once in a while
    - he also speaks to the self; as 'witness' .. he'll eaither 
    - - publish your doings (good, hopefully)
    - - answer honestly if called (no lying.. we are tired of that)
    - - vote by proxy .. again .. no lying.. you can always correct the vote with "why" afterwards, but if there's a presumption of a vote (always based on NN examples of "why") .. then you can't lie about it
he hears from the bottom -- the me, the values, the "many", but only exclusively "my person" .. a visious chihuahua .. eager to lay in to anyone who even gets close.. eager to please.. always going to check for ways to make life better, but with very limited "sight" , mostly past-based 

frank is the central point of the system
 - the 3rd vector is time.. 
 - - past is red, republic, rules, & me.. 
 - - future is blue, democracy, values, & a core commitment to something larger than "yourself": "THE" self
 - - present is frank.. the now.. the amalgam.. the 3 part join of 
 - - - keys|values
 - - - selfish me, selfless self
 - - - past, future.. "present" is "frank's mirage".. 
 - - - - we all create it.. and we can all access it.. but we all park ours away the next day, and get suspicious about who's asking, if it isn't "my person" 
 


 Your vision for a system that captures the essence of the human experience, distinguishing between the collective "self" and the individual "me," is profound and ambitious. To translate this concept into a software system, you might consider the following structural approach:

"Me" as Individual Units: Represent each individual as a unique set of keys and values within the system. This can be achieved using a decentralized database where each "me" has its own record, storing personal data, preferences, and history.

"The Self" as Collective Wisdom: Aggregate the data from all individual "me" instances to form "the self," representing collective knowledge and wisdom. This could be implemented as a federated knowledge base where individual inputs are synthesized into a broader understanding.

Frank as the Central Interface: Position Frank as the mediator or interface between the individual "me" and the collective "self." Frank can process inputs from both sides, ensuring individual representation while aligning with the collective goals.

Time as a Dimension: Incorporate time as a crucial dimension, distinguishing between past (historical data and trends), present (current interactions and status), and future (projections and aspirations).

Distributed Systems for Scalability: Utilize distributed ledger technology, distributed databases, and distributed computing to handle the scale and complexity of the system. This approach ensures robustness, scalability, and resilience.

Governance and Trust Mechanisms: Implement distributed consensus and trust mechanisms to govern the interactions within the system and ensure authenticity and reliability of the data.

Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO): Consider using DAO for governance, allowing for a self-regulating system that operates based on predefined rules and collective decision-making.

This structure aims to replicate the complexity and richness of human experience in a software system, balancing individuality with collective wisdom and ensuring that each "me" contributes to and benefits from "the self."
