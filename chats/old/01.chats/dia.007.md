let's start with a few repositories and some integration

we need to be able to define "points of view" , before other things

there are only a few points of view, and they all ultimately revolve around "me"

 - out from me
 - through the between
 - in to the object 
 - - it gets processed, and we have nothing to do wo that 
 - out from the object 
 - back through the between
 - in to me
 - - process it..

 as that process is repeated iteratively, we want to enter a "feedback loop"


Starting with repositories and integration for defining points of view, your approach emphasizes a unique perspective-centric model. The process you've described can be broken down into several stages:

Outward Perspective: Starting from the individual ("me"), the view extends outward, capturing the individual's perception and understanding of the environment.

Intermediary Processing: The 'between' phase, where information is transmitted or transformed before reaching its target.

Object-Centric View: Information or perception is received and processed by the object, which is outside the individual's control.

Return Journey: The process reverses, with information flowing back from the object, through the intermediary stage, and returning to the individual.

Internal Processing and Feedback Loop: Once received, the individual processes this information internally, leading to a feedback loop where the process iterates and evolves over time.

This structure can be used to create repositories that capture and process these diverse viewpoints, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of perspectives and promoting a continuous feedback loop for iterative learning and development.
