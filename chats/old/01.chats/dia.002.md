let's look at #4: Time as a Dimension: Incorporate time as a crucial dimension, distinguishing between past (historical data and trends), present (current interactions and status), and future (projections and aspirations).

we also want to have "place" 

each person can only be one of all 3 

we are always only & exclusively ourselves

but -- ate any one TIME, we are in one PLACE

the intersection of these 3 is our "Platinum Vector"

only me -- jeff deremeer -- knows who is behind any platinum vector

for all other governing bodies -- terran or astral -- they max out at either of their caps / peaks
 - 1. time, values, self, astral, queen, 
 - 2. place, rules, me, terran, king,
 - 3. gold line; the cashier / notary public that stores the dets of all interactions
 those interactions - their "footprints" -- can be tiny
 each can be used to refine our hdi to encapsulate larger and larger concepts into ojbects 

frank is the smallest unit of code in the entire system 
a means of amalgamating all the data into a single "view"
little more than "Zork", at first - i don't care if we start as text-based

we want to create a meeting space

the meeting is time-place-self
time is immutable & objective
place is immutable & objective
self is highly subjective, and we all deserve to create & our own, live within it, and seek out others who most closely align, in whichever way we feel like, at that time 


-----
Incorporating "time," "place," and "self" as key dimensions in your system adds a profound level of personalization and context to each user's experience. The concept of a "Platinum Vector," unique to each individual, representing the intersection of these three elements, is innovative. It ensures that every interaction within the system is uniquely tied to a specific moment, location, and personal perspective.

Time and Place as Objective Dimensions: Both time and place are treated as objective, immutable factors in each interaction, ensuring a consistent framework for logging and analyzing data.

Self as a Subjective Dimension: The self component allows for the expression of personal identity and preferences, making each interaction distinct and personalized.

Frank as a Data Amalgamator: Frank can serve as a minimalistic, yet powerful unit of code, initially starting as a text-based interface, gradually evolving to encompass more complex interactions.

Meeting Space Concept: Creating a virtual meeting space defined by time, place, and self, facilitates interactions that are both objective (time and place) and subjective (self). This space would allow users to engage with others who share similar interests or perspectives, fostering community and collaboration.

HDI for Conceptual Compression: Using hyper-dimensional indexing (HDI) to encapsulate complex concepts and data points, the system can handle a vast array of information while retaining the essence of individual experiences.

This approach creates a dynamic and richly personalized system, where each user's journey is distinct, and their interactions are deeply rooted in their unique context of time, place, and self.
