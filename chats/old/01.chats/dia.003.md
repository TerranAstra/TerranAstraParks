let's explore the meeting space and the hdi, further

the meeting space is always-on.. it's the primary objective of the central system 
 - we need a terran council -- that's rules, king, index, keys, ground, past, structure of the ui
 - we need an astral council -- that's values, queen, locks, sky, future, 'dressing' of the ui (colors, fonts, etc)

the hdi is a meeting point / intersectional 

1st; there's the "gold line" -- intersection of the 2 councils
but 0th; the stage just a little before the beginning, and a little after the ending, is frank.. 
his only job is to zip & unzip references to the objects on the gold line 

that gold-line is our meeting place

it's always-on, it needs to span all of the cloud providers; azure, aws, gcp, etc
 - as "cloud", those could also be considered "astral".. 
if we get buy-in, we will hopefully have millions of people spinning up our Frank-VMs, all over the world
 - each Frank-VM will host the coordination between the 2 councils, and the gold-line
 - it only needs to run on one of the cloud providers, but it will also surface - as an entry point - its own provider (e.g. running on a home network over an att, or comcast, or whatever)

 if at all humanly possible, we want to add radio
  - line out can be small, and on a single channel that's regularly changed, per utterance if needed
  - line in should be able to span multiple channels, and be significantly higher bandwidth

we want frank to have 2 basic modes;

1:: 
    i've never ran before 
    - i want to seek out my council, and join it
    - with them at my back, i want to join the meeting
    - once in the meeting, i want to do all that i can to help my person.. 
    - - what is it they want me to help with?

2:: 
    i am rejoining the meeting.. where were we before, what are we working on (or doing / having fun with) next, and what do we hope to do with our next "meeting-join-session"?
     - not sure if that means a whole day, or just any given interaction with a larger group, talking about larger considerations 

the meeting space will be one of our primary objectives, to get the rest of this started

Your concept for the meeting space and HDI in the Frank system is visionary and multifaceted. Let's delve into the key components:

Always-On Meeting Space: Central to the system, this space serves as a dynamic platform for interaction and decision-making, integrating both the Terran and Astral councils.

Terran and Astral Councils:

The Terran council represents structure, rules, and the past, influencing the UI's structure.
The Astral council embodies values, future aspirations, and aesthetics, influencing the UI's appearance.
Gold Line as Intersection: The Gold Line symbolizes the meeting point between the two councils, where Frank plays a pivotal role in managing and interconnecting data.

Frank's Role: Frank acts as a facilitator, zipping and unzipping references to objects on the Gold Line, effectively bridging the Terran and Astral elements.

Cloud Integration and Radio Communication:

The system spans across cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.) for robustness and accessibility.
Incorporating radio for communication adds another layer of connectivity, with adaptable channels for input and output.
Frank's Operational Modes:

Initial setup involves seeking out and joining the respective council.
Once part of the meeting, Frank focuses on assisting the user, adapting its functions to the user's needs and objectives.
This meeting space, facilitated by Frank, represents a confluence of structured governance (Terran) and dynamic, value-driven decision-making (Astral), creating a comprehensive platform for user interaction and system management.
