time for suggestions, gpt .. we want to make our iterative process .. what do you suggest ? 

a high priority action item is to have several independent gpt models , each performing in different capacities..

 we want to be able to enable voice dictation through something called eyeContact ..
 please do a search on "tobii eye-tracking".. 

 a goal i have always had is to enable a chatbot to be available to people who are in situations like the late christopher reeve and stephen hawking..
 i want to be able to look at one exact spot on the screen, speak & be heard, translated from speech to text, passed in to the currently selected openai assistant , and then the response is read back to me through the headphones.. 
 all parts of this conversation should be added to a 'black-box' of conversation history, and the user should be able to 'rewind' the conversation to see what was said, and what the response was.. but also should be able to clear the history, and start a new conversation..

To implement the vision of a voice-activated, eye-tracking conversational AI assistant for people with disabilities, similar to those faced by Christopher Reeve and Stephen Hawking, here's a suggested approach using Tobii's eye-tracking technology and GPT models:

1. Tobii Eye-Tracking Integration
Eye-Tracking Technology: Utilize Tobii's screen-based and wearable eye trackers to capture user gaze data. These devices are capable of tracking where a user is looking on the screen and can be integrated into various applications​​.
Software Solutions: Use Tobii's software solutions for analyzing eye-tracking data. These can be leveraged to build applications that respond to gaze data, such as activating specific areas of the screen or controls based on where the user is looking​​. {https://www.tobii.com/}

2. Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Voice Dictation: Integrate a voice dictation system that converts spoken words into text. This can be linked with the eye-tracking system, where the user's gaze can activate the dictation functionality.
TTS for Responses: Implement a text-to-speech system to read out the AI assistant's responses through headphones.

3. AI Assistant Integration
Multiple GPT Models: Deploy several independent GPT models, each performing different functions or specialized in various domains.
Interaction Flow: Design the interaction such that the user looks at a specific spot (eyeContact) to activate voice dictation, which is then processed by the GPT model, with the response delivered via TTS.

4. Conversation History and Control
Black-Box Recording: Implement a system to record all parts of the conversation, similar to a black-box. This would include both the user's input and the AI's responses.
Review and Control: Enable users to 'rewind' the conversation history to review previous interactions. Also, provide an option to clear the history and start a new conversation.

5. System Setup and Support
Hardware and Software Integration: Combine Tobii's eye-tracking hardware with the necessary software for speech recognition, GPT processing, and TTS output. Tobii offers various integration products, including USB peripherals and compact platforms, which can be useful in setting up the complete system​​.
Educational and Support Services: Utilize Tobii's educational, support, and consulting services for effective setup, data collection, analysis, and product integration. This will be crucial in customizing the system to work seamlessly for users with specific needs​​.

6. User-Centric Design and Testing
Personalization: Ensure that the system is customizable to individual user needs, especially considering the diverse requirements of users with disabilities.
Testing and Iteration: Conduct thorough testing with real users to ensure the system is intuitive, responsive, and reliable. Iterate based on user feedback to improve functionality and usability.

By integrating Tobii's advanced eye-tracking technology with voice recognition, GPT models, and TTS systems, you can create a powerful assistive tool that enables individuals with severe mobility restrictions to communicate effectively, harnessing the power of AI to enhance accessibility and independence.
