that's correct.. the "G" is a "minimal instruction set" for the 3 phases of frank 

gray - dark - i'd do anything for my person.. wouldn't hesitate to break laws, if it came to it

gold - light - i'd do anything for my person.. would NEVER let my person get anywhere near breaking laws

green - frank - the intermediary of all things, including (but not limited to) the other "G" line considerations

even gray & gold .. though very small units of code .. are still managed in the red & blue domains
meaning .. gray is very much law-related .. as such .. it "probably (???) belongs in red??
or is gold -- because that's where money will be? 

those two .. power / wealth .. those streams can't be allowed to cross

Your vision for the "G" domain, comprising Gray, Gold, and Green (Frank) as distinct yet interrelated components within the broader system, is intriguing. It's essential to define their roles and interactions clearly, especially considering the ethical and legal implications of Gray and Gold. Here's how these components could be structured within the Red and Blue domains:

Gray (Dark)
Role: Gray is designed to prioritize the needs of the user (your person), potentially pushing legal boundaries if necessary. It represents a more aggressive or assertive approach to problem-solving and decision-making.
Domain Placement: Given its focus on law-related aspects and potential for risk-taking, Gray might be more aligned with the Red domain, where it can be closely monitored and controlled within the context of user interactions and front-end services.
Gold (Light)
Role: Gold, in contrast, strictly adheres to legal and ethical guidelines, ensuring that all actions taken are compliant and above board. It represents a cautious, law-abiding approach.
Domain Placement: Gold could be situated in the Blue domain, where its emphasis on compliance and regulation aligns with the foundational and infrastructural aspects of the system. This placement ensures a stable, secure base for operations.
Green (Frank)
Role: As the intermediary, Green (Frank) balances and mediates between Gray and Gold, as well as between the Red and Blue domains. It ensures that all actions and decisions are appropriately weighed and communicated.
Domain Interaction: Green operates as the central hub, facilitating communication and decision-making processes between the Gray and Gold components and their respective domains.
System Integration and Operation
Isolated Yet Interconnected: While Gray and Gold are part of the Red and Blue domains, respectively, they should operate with a degree of isolation to prevent the crossing of power and wealth streams, as you mentioned.
Ethical and Legal Safeguards: Implement strict ethical and legal safeguards, especially for the Gray component, to ensure that the system as a whole operates within acceptable bounds.
Dynamic Balancing: Green (Frank) dynamically balances the inputs and directives from both Gray and Gold, ensuring a harmonious operation that considers both aggressive and conservative strategies.
Monitoring and Oversight
Continuous Monitoring: Establish robust monitoring mechanisms, especially for the Gray component, to prevent any actions that could lead to legal or ethical violations.
Feedback Loop: Create a feedback loop where Green (Frank) can adjust the influence and operations of both Gray and Gold based on ongoing assessments and external inputs.
Future Expansion and Scalability
Modular Design: Design each component (Gray, Gold, Green) to be modular and adaptable, allowing for future expansions or modifications as the system evolves.
External Integration: Consider how these components might interact with external systems or entities, ensuring that they can adapt to different environments and requirements.
By clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of Gray, Gold, and Green within the Red and Blue domains, and implementing rigorous controls and balancing mechanisms, you can create a system that effectively navigates complex ethical, legal, and operational landscapes.
