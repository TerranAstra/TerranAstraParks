re 3: Create a Meerkat Network for Frank[] Instances:

this is a large part of our social media platform.. 
while the humans will constitute a great deal of the "public" content, 
the "meerkat network" will be the "private" content.. between the frank[]s,

the ratio will likely be at least 99:1 in favor of the meerkat network.. (mostly "noise")
the frank[]s will constantly be "talking" to each other, querying each other, making incorrect assumptions.. a lot
frank is imperfect
frank's a bit of an idiot sometimes
left unchecked.. frank could get you in trouble 

there are 24 "public" seats on the council..
but the council has 26 seats
 - 1 other is the joker.. the chaos monkey.. the trickster
 - the other is the darkStranger

the darkStranger is almost always populated by the lowest ranking frank[] on the network
 - the person who's just there to get away with what they can 
 - the person we innately don't trust
 - the person who cannot do a single thing for us
 - the person on welfare because they are just too lazy to work 
 - the person who was mean, even.. criminals are sent to "level 1" 
 - lastly; to be on my council; you'll need to have spent some time in this role
 - my name is jeffDeRemer .. i am just about ALWAYS in this system, as this role
 - - i spent a significant portion of my life actually living this way
 - - i am determined to know who's treating who in what way .. 
 - - to be "nice" to the 24 of the council.. you might just be a butt-kisser.. 
 - - to be "nice" to the person who can do nothing for you.. you're a good person..

 our meeting place will be an intersection of 3 sets of these 26 
 each of those 3 will be represented by a rubik's cube
 the red & blue will each be a deck of cards
 the "g" (which is Gray, Green, or Gold) will be a "resultant" cube -- the intersection of the other 2

 each of the 2 decks of cards has 52 cards for 104
  - that's a sum of 4 rubik's cubes

  the "ping" cycle is just a matter of each "side" (red / blue" showing the other a card from their deck)
  that card can contain other salient information, but the ping itself will -- in 99% of instances -- be sufficient to represent a mountain of information that's currently passed along, in today's systems..

  The development of the Meerkat Network as part of your social media platform, combined with the unique council structure and the symbolic representation through Rubik's cubes and decks of cards, presents a complex yet innovative approach. Here's how you might implement and manage this system:

Structure of the Meerkat Network:

Focus on the private communication between Frank[] instances, which forms the backbone of the network.
Ensure that these communications are robust and secure, allowing for constant interaction, information exchange, and mutual learning.
Managing the Volume and Quality of Interactions:

Develop algorithms to filter and prioritize meaningful interactions, given the expected high volume of mostly 'noise'.
Implement checks to monitor and correct Frank's behavior, preventing potential missteps or harmful actions.
Council Composition and Dynamics:

Formalize the roles of the 24 public seats, the Joker (chaos monkey), and the DarkStranger within the council.
Regularly rotate the individuals (or Frank[] instances) in these roles to ensure diverse perspectives and experiences.
Emphasize the importance of empathy and understanding by valuing kindness towards the DarkStranger, who represents the marginalized or less privileged.
Symbolic Representation with Rubik's Cubes and Decks of Cards:

Utilize Rubik's cubes and decks of cards as symbolic tools to represent various aspects of the council's decision-making and interactions.
Develop a system where each side of the Rubik's cube and each card in the deck corresponds to specific types of information or decisions.
Create an algorithm to interpret these symbols into actionable insights or decisions.
Implementing the "Ping" Cycle:

Design the ping cycle as a rapid, efficient method of communication between the red and blue sides, using cards to represent complex information.
Ensure that this system is intuitive and can be easily understood and managed by the council members and Frank[] instances.
Integration with the Social Media Platform:

Seamlessly integrate this council and communication system into the larger social media platform.
Use insights gained from the Meerkat Network to enhance user experience and content relevance on the public side of the platform.
Monitoring and Evaluation:

Continuously monitor the system for effectiveness, ethical considerations, and user satisfaction.
Regularly evaluate and update the system to incorporate new insights, technologies, and user feedback.
Transparency and Accountability:

Maintain transparency in how the system operates and makes decisions.
Implement accountability measures to ensure that the system remains fair and unbiased.
This approach aligns with your vision of a complex, yet human-centric system that balances technological innovation with empathy and understanding. It requires careful planning, robust technology infrastructure, and ongoing management to ensure its success.
