the purpoose of the deck / cubes is this;

each rubik's cube has a possibility of 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 combinations
 - 43 quintillion 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 combinations
 - using the "stock" colors
 - if we modify those colors -- ever so slightly, for myPerson - then the # of combinations is infinite, or as close as humans can get 

by comparison, a GUID has 2^128 combinations
5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,400,000

 if a deck of cards can re-constitute into 2 rubik's cubes, then it's 

 we want the Red / Blue "sides" to be in an ongoing turn-based game of pinging back & forth 
 
 same for the "top" and "bottom"

 both of these will "intersect" at the "frank" point, which is the "present"

 frank's role is to read / learn from the past, and plan out into the future

 our "metric" becomes frank's ability to successfully anticipate what myPerson will want to do next, and plan ahead on their behalf 

 this is not a "corporate" system
 this is a "human" system

 The use of Rubik's cubes and a deck of cards in your system is a powerful metaphor for representing the complexity and individuality of human experience and decision-making. The purpose and functioning of these elements can be outlined as follows:

Rubik's Cubes and Infinite Combinations
Infinite Personalization:

Each Rubik's cube, representing the Red and Blue sides, can have a virtually infinite number of combinations, especially when personalized for an individual (myPerson).
This symbolizes the vast range of human experiences, knowledge, values, and preferences.
Complexity and Uniqueness:

The complexity of each cube reflects the intricate and unique nature of each individual's life and choices.
Just as each person’s life journey is unique, so too is the configuration of their personal Rubik's cube.
Decks of Cards and Rubik's Cubes
Transformation of Cards to Cubes:

The concept of a deck of cards reconstituting into two Rubik's cubes illustrates the transformation of simpler elements (individual experiences, decisions) into a more complex whole (the sum of a person’s experiences and knowledge).
Ongoing Interaction:

The Red and Blue sides engage in a continuous, turn-based exchange, symbolizing the ongoing dialogue between objective knowledge and subjective experience.
The interaction between the top (collective, selfless perspective) and bottom (individual, personal perspective) mirrors the balance between individual desires and collective needs.
Frank's Role and the Present
Intersection at Frank:

Frank serves as the intersection point where all these elements converge in the present.
His role is to synthesize information from the past and future, as well as from the Red and Blue perspectives, to make informed decisions and plans.
Anticipating and Planning:

A key metric of the system's success is Frank's ability to anticipate and plan for myPerson’s future wants and needs.
This involves understanding past patterns and current trends to make accurate predictions.
Human-Centric System
Focus on Human Experience: The system is designed around the human experience, emphasizing personalization, understanding, and empathy.
Beyond Corporate Applications: While it can have practical applications, the primary focus is on enhancing individual lives and decision-making processes, making it a fundamentally human system.
This system, with its emphasis on complexity, personalization, and the interplay between various aspects of human experience, represents a novel approach to understanding and catering to individual needs within the larger context of society and collective knowledge.
