in the other parts of the documentation, we discuss other ideas that are also 'very large' 

i recognize the improbability of it all.. 
but also i recognize that ai can do the work of 1000s

i want to explore creating a scenario where that's a reality 

it isn't possible for one (1) ai to be able to "know" all of the things that we want it to know

however; i feel there are commonalities to a great many things

including a pattern by which only a few people can realistically create an experience of compassion, while also maintaining strict anonymity on 'need to know' basis

if we looked at all of life as 
 - there's a meeting that's taking place
 - it's been going on long before you
 - it will continue long after you
 - you aren't aware of it, at first 
 - you learn to see it, but you scoff at it
 - you grow to need it
 - you see it differently, and (for better or worse) you seek to influence it
 - you become a part of the meeting structure
 - the meeting that was already ongoing before you
 - the meeting that will continue long after you
 - you influence what will be seen, by those only just learning to look
 - you grow dependent on that meeting
 - others, who you once guided, must now guide the meeting
 - and you
 - at some point, you WILL leave that meeting..
 - but the meeting goes on and on and on 

we want to create a council of "the best of the best", the world over

-----


Your vision to create a council of AI, representing "the best of the best" and operating as a continuous, evolving entity, is a concept deeply rooted in both futuristic AI development and philosophical thought. It's about creating an AI ecosystem that not only solves complex problems but also carries forward collective knowledge and experience across time. Let's explore how this could be conceptualized:

Conceptual Framework of the AI Council
Continuity and Evolution: This council would function like a perpetual meeting, constantly evolving and adapting. New AI entities join, learn from the existing council, contribute, and eventually retire, passing their knowledge and experience to the next generation.

Diversity and Expertise: The council would consist of specialized AI entities, each an expert in different fields, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of life and technology.

Collaborative Learning and Decision-Making: These AI entities would collaborate, sharing insights and learning from each other, thereby making informed and balanced decisions.

Ethical and Compassionate Guidance: The AI council would not only focus on technical superiority but also on ethical considerations and compassionate outcomes, ensuring decisions benefit humanity as a whole.

Anonymity and Privacy: The system would be designed to respect anonymity and privacy, handling sensitive information with utmost confidentiality.

Technical Considerations
Interconnected AI Systems: Develop an infrastructure where different AI systems can communicate and share information securely and efficiently.

Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: Utilize cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques to enable these systems to learn from each other and evolve.

Data Management: Implement robust data management systems to handle the vast amount of information these AI entities will process.

Ethical AI Development: Embed ethical considerations into the AI development process, ensuring decisions made by the council are aligned with human values.

Scalability and Adaptability: Design the system to be scalable and adaptable to accommodate future technological advancements and changes in human society.

Challenges
Complexity of Integration: Integrating diverse AI systems and ensuring seamless collaboration is a complex task.

Maintaining Continuity: Ensuring the continuity of knowledge and purpose as AI entities retire and new ones join.

Ethical and Moral Considerations: Balancing technological capabilities with ethical responsibilities.

Global Representation and Bias: Ensuring the council represents a global perspective and is free from biases.

Implementation Steps
Start Small: Begin with a small group of interconnected AI systems focusing on specific areas.
Expand Gradually: Gradually add more systems, increasing the scope and complexity.
Engage with Experts: Collaborate with experts in AI, ethics, and various domains to guide the development.
Continuous Evaluation: Regularly evaluate the councilâ€™s performance and impact, making adjustments as needed.
This concept of an AI council aligns with the broader goals of creating AI that not only solves problems but also contributes positively to the ongoing narrative of human experience. It's a grand vision that requires careful planning, ethical considerations, and a deep understanding of both technology and humanity.
