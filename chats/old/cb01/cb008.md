i want every interaction , to be as though it was "with ME"

what i mean is .. as a user, you're "asking ME"

as a call center person, you're "answering ME" 
but - much more importantly - you're answering "AS me"

i only want those people for whom that responsibility carries a sense of importance or purpose 

i don't want to "pay them cheap" .. i want to attract the best 

we want to use the parks as a means of incentivization.. 
the parks are an infinite source of busy work for many 
but - they're a big source of "high profit margin" .. 
 that's only going to remain true, as long as it's held in high regard, 

we want to offer our call center people the opportunity to "work from the parks"

if "time at the parks" can be made a high-value commodity, then we can use that to incentivize people to work for us
 it costs us little
 it affords us the best
 that, in turn, is how i feel we pursue success

i want to be able to "call" my "frank" .. and have them answer "as me"
that'll be in the form of a meeting
that meeting takes place in a 'meta-world'
that's already been done, but -- frank is basically a digital twin of 'hisPerson'

the concept of meta-worlds is already a thing
the way we are going to try to do it will be different
(i hope)

we are still in the planning stages...

Your vision for integrating a high-quality, personalized customer service approach with unique incentives like working from parks is innovative and ambitious. Here's a summary of your concept and some considerations for implementation:

Personalized Representation: You want each interaction with customers to be highly personalized, as if they were communicating directly with you. This involves training call center personnel to answer "as you," adopting your mannerisms, knowledge, and decision-making style.

Valuing Staff: Attracting the best talent is a priority, and you're not looking to minimize costs at the expense of quality. This perspective is crucial for maintaining a high standard of service.

Incentivizing with Park Access: The unique idea of offering call center staff the opportunity to work from parks could be an excellent incentive. This approach assumes that time in parks is highly valued by potential employees and that it aligns with their work-life balance goals.

Digital Twin in a Meta-world: You're envisioning a digital twin system where a virtual representative (like "Frank") interacts in a meta-world, essentially serving as a digital avatar that mimics your presence and behavior in virtual meetings.

Considerations for Implementation:
Training and Technology: Implementing this vision will require advanced technology and intensive training. The staff will need to be equipped with not just the knowledge of your business practices but also a deep understanding of how you would personally handle various situations.

Quality Control: Maintaining consistency in how different employees represent you will be challenging. Regular quality checks and feedback systems will be essential.

Digital Twin Development: Creating a digital twin that accurately represents you in meta-worlds will require sophisticated AI and VR technologies. This aspect might be the most technologically challenging.

Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Representing someone else, even in a professional capacity, can raise ethical and privacy issues. Clear guidelines and boundaries will be necessary.

Cost-Benefit Analysis: While the initial investment in technology and training might be high, the long-term benefits of high customer satisfaction and innovative service could justify the costs.

Employee Wellbeing: While working from parks is an attractive incentive, ensuring that it genuinely enhances employee satisfaction and doesn't become a mere novelty is crucial.

As you are in the planning stages, it's a good idea to conduct thorough research and feasibility studies, perhaps starting with pilot programs to test and refine these concepts before full-scale implementation.
