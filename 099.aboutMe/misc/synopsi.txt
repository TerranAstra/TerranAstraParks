 * i would like to generate a synopsis for each of the endeavors
it's ok if there's overlap between them
as long as their primary focus is the topic at hand 
i'd like to get summaries for 

"infrastructure of up" TM 
 * pods
 * mobility / chassis
 * 'buses' & yachts
 * ice halo
 * space elevator
 * gliders (overlaps to parks)

parks
 * park-araunts
 * work locations by waterfalls & landscaped hills - on 'trains' through the parks
 * glide-rides.. about 1,000,000 times more fun than any roller coaster - this is an overlapping feature between "parks" & "Up"
houses on ridge lines
 - launch lines on ridge lines (glide rides)
 - - mansions on mountains - sell these to the billionaires! pay for all of this, by selling just a few dozen / few hundred(?) of the "Mansion on a Mountain, with a freekn Yacht in it!!" TM 

Software systems
 * Concierge - a global MMO-RPG - no matter where in the world you are - find "quests" such as "flip burgers at joes" or "plant trees" and "build trails" and -- most importantly "build balloons" .. we will need hundreds of millions of house-sized balloons
the concierge will need to manage engineering of all of the hardware considerations, related to "up".. we want those as open-source as possible, but not in such a way that any other company is allowed to use them for their profits .. we want to democratize out the ability to have millions contribute & critique.. 
however; we are rolling all profits into a giant "piggy bank" .. saving towards the space elevator 
 * Lingua Franca - a new "common tongue" 
 * Frank .. a "Curious", compassionate, always-on bot that trains on all of the things that make you you, and make me me .. "a robot named 'me'" TM
