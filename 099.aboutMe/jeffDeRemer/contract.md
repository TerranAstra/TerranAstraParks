i had a boss at 19 .. we were best friends and went drinking occasionally. he told me 'jeff, everybody sees we are best friends. i can't give you special treatment. in fact; i need to raise my expectations'

this was good & right.. that was 30+ years ago. that's going to be _our_ relationship.. if you want to be a part of my inner team; please know i have expectations that go far beyond individual accountability (which is so sorely lacking, today)

at 17 i worked at a gas station.. we all took turns cleaning the bathroom.. one night - my turn - someone left something _awful_.. i was pissed, but it was my night, and i steeled myself to do what needed to be done.. my boss grabbed the cleaning supplies, grabbed the angry, told us all "there will never come a time when i ask any of my people to do anything that i myself wouldn't do".. that story also stays with me..

i have ad**H**d, with an extreme "H".. lots of people claim the same.. and then they do cocaine.. i pass out from it.. point is; i am 'on the spectrum'.. i own that 

i may also have a touch of sociopathy.. my childhood had some trauma that i know i have never left behind. i know the burden of this.. but also i know that i learned many many years ago to turn that by 180 degrees.. here's the thing about that, though; i know i've got strength to do so, where other may not always.. however; i learned to do so with a complete detachment of emotion ..
