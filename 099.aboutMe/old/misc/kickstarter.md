My name is Jeff DeRemer.  With Charon Software.   
I would like to use this Kickstarter page for their primary purpose -- kickstarting something huge.  
I have this dream that humanity can & should have flying cars. In the longer-term, I also feel that 
humanity can & should get into space. Getting into space would take a global workforce of millions, with 
a budget of potentially trillions. I don’t have that. To pay for the space infrastructure, I propose we build 
a flying car infrastructure. That will be its own worthy endeavor but will cost billions. I don’t have that, 
either. To pay for the flying cars, I propose we build a global network of Parks. This kick-starter is an 
effort to raise funding for that first park.  
In the long-term, parks will be thousands of acres, with activities, nature trails, and most importantly, 
fabrication for the flying car infrastructure. But this funding will be for a more modest “our first park”. I 
would like to see if there are investors who can see the long-term vision of some of what I have 
described in some YouTube videos I have available HERE.  
I see this first park as being near to where I live now (just outside of Atlanta, GA). It will start small – a 
restaurant like we are used to, with a few gazebo eating spaces. In larger parks, as funding comes in, I 
hope to add nature rides in your own private ground-pod.  
I don’t see these as being ‘open to the public’. I want to grow a core team of folks who believe – as I do 
– that we can accomplish great things by working together with common goals. To accomplish that; I 
want to create an emphasis on “Dude Ranch” style of work, right up front. I do not have any 
“employees”. Where they’re required by law, of course. Otherwise, I see greater value in democratizing 
the investments, as well as the rewards. I want these to be where people will advance their place in line 
to take delivery of final flying cars. To do that, we will put an emphasis on people who’ve invested time 
& work, more than those who’ve simply paid for a meal.  
As we have more of these parks - I hope to create a global network of places where we are able to earn 
vacation time all over the world – no matter your place on the socio-economic ladder, while working 
towards the common goal of flying cars & outer space, and possibly tackling global warming head-on. 
There are models in place for global mega corporations already. I want to emulate one of those, but 
with a single unified long-term goal of building something positive, for all of us to believe in. I know I 
may be dreaming big in the long term. But I know in the short term, we can at least get started with this 
first park. I hope to hear from some folks that also believe that change is possible.  
Thank You!
