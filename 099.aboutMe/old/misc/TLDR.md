I'm a nobody, but i am going for it .. 

i do take both parts seriously, my odds -next to zero-, as well as the role 

this is the fact; humanity is carrying on in "business as usual" mode

housing is dead. economy is dead. dollar is dead. hope feels dead. they're still comparing dick sizes on which side pumped more oil
regardless of those - the seas are literally boiling. the skies are literally burning

two possible outcomes to my story - i am wrong, or i am right

if i am wrong - humanity's takeaway is a global infrastructure, able to serve the needs of nearly anyone
a thing WE WILL NEED -- we CANNOT be shooting one another down 

if i am right - we get multiple contingency plans

regardless -- there are directions i'd like to pursue 

# abolish unemployment
    a new & highly commoditizable resource; "park time" 
    - made for free, used advantageously - could be a game changer in terms of incentivization
    - i simply do not have dollars
