'silencing our voices - loudest w shout-down

"BEGBY", team, ambassador, "MY Plank/their sawdust" / them 

our ego v hearing someone/anything different "this is what i know, i got papers"

chickens / pigs
 - 'you payin'??!"
 - put up / shut up 
 - taxation / representation

most aren't aware of what they're missing

PoE
- lgbtq
- blk
religion(s)
guns

calculus of gun sales

delusions of adequacy

the only versions of "them" i'll accept are ones that are "us" .. 
 - elderly, homeless, special needs, mentally ill, today; tranq

bowTies n bullShit

not a "company" .. one big "book of regulations" - a new "lingua franca" - "frank"

input , but not keyboard

i can see clearly all that's wrong w THEIR work ethic .. as for mine? I'm insulted at anyone's mention 
 - sawdust in "our" eye, vs just "my"

about me - i hate the ide of "life happening to me" .. that's what i feel surrounded by -- people with "that introverted `this is it` look .. on most of their faces"

i was rat, cheese, maze, technician .. w weed & pc books .. i need self starters of any kind,, but also not everyone can be that so c'mon
