my name is jeff deremer
i have no idea if no-names can win 
but if great ideas, & comprehensive plans are still worth *anything in this country -- i will be our 47th president 

seems like .. life is just a story / someone else's dream 
	- i'd like to try to make ours a better one 

last few months - i've taken 1,000s of pages notes, recorded hundreds of videos
	time's up, and they barely mention half of the ideas i wanted to share 
2 years -> S.O. & i ~~ 1,000 hours -> system piece
	- they only got 5 slides. time's up 
	- vector-driven db ARE future 
	- - i'm not the only one exploring that 
	- - like the other pieces of all the rest of this; my approach to vDB is ..perhaps.. novel / unique 

these videos clearly suck
since the first batch - i have decided .. i am running 
	- let's face it; 
	- biden is weak 
	- rfk is more than enough to topple biden 
	- we CANNOT have a 2nd drumpf term 

like i said; i have no idea if unknowns can win, but .. i can't just sit by 

you're going to have to ask yourselves if you feel that msgs of "you need to be pissed!" are how you want to live your life?? 
	- do you want endless messages of "be enraged because it's righteous & justified!!" 
	- or would you prefer messages of "let's build a new empire" 
	- & "let's be the best versions of ourselves that we can" 
	- and -- "let's work together" on something.. anything.. other than just bashing each other senseless 

if "uniting" people is the goal (& honestly; i can't tell, anymore) 
	- this country is torn apart in ways that feel ~almost unrecoverable
	- - i don't want to give in to that 
	- not even at a point of "be nice to each other", anymore.. 
	- it's more like "stop condemning your own souls" .. that's closer to the levels of hate 

i don't need to know aout your 
	- religion 
	- gender .. or .. orientation 
	- skin color 
	- *any *of it 
	- i know that *you believe in *your hot topic 
	- - i probably support it, i mean that honestly .. 
	- BUT - we need a break from the talking points that are tearing this country apart 
	- we need to find ways of handling them that don't involve "public stoning" 
	- most of all; we need to find something we can *all work *towards, *together 

i have my agenda, too - i want a break from all those other agendas 
i can't be the president to ALL of you, by taking sides with SOME of you 

the agenda items that i want to elevate for a while -- are ones i feel we all share 
	- nature is good - let's put our hands in the dirt
	- flying cars are better - let's all be chauffered around, no more traffic 
	- exploration is best - no matter who you are 
	- - we all love learning new things
	- - we all love going new places
	- - we all love meeting new people

to fully accomplish all of this will take $ trillions & a workflorce of ~2bn people
our story will need to be bigger & better than some of the best 
	- robin hood 	- - no stealing - - i can do better - make them want to share 
	- henry ford 	- - "car for the common man", sure .. didn't offer "earn cars - AND HOMES - on vacation" 
	- founding fathers? - - shoulders of giants here, but they didn't have 'bill of responsibilities' 

today's stories are all so greedy .. what do they want? stacks of dollars? 
	- "representation, without any taxation" 
	- continuation seems like inevitable destruction 
	- the path AWAY from destruction; is change 

maybe i'm greedy, too. what is it *i want?? 
	- flying cars & complete infrastructure 
	- space elevator named mt olympus , on a man-made island in the middle of the pacific 
	- the ability to visit the whole world!
	- the ability to get PAID to visit the whole world!!
	- a compassionate robot, a robot named "me", a robot that always has our back 

"all i need to do" :-) 
	- convince 1,200 billionaires (or- most of them) that they want mansions on mountains
	- - and flying yachts, inside those mansions
	- convince 2-3m ppl in leadership - same.. home-pods.. efficiencies in them
	- convince 3-500m middle class - home cubbies on mountainsides, w pods for the buses - you want that 
	- convince 3-5bn - vacations all over the world - paid for by work - you want that 
	- all people who want to work toward the shared dream of getting into space 
	- all of this while living full-time next to launch tubes that we developed from our glide-rides

easy, right?? 
"all i need to do" :-( 
	- convince YOU .. to change 

no idea if i can be any of those things this country so badly needs
	- here for a better story
	- & beg you all .. turn from "brother v brother" 
	- *your soul is worth more than *their echo chamber 

massive divides in this country .. nothing that unites us 
	- only 'safe' topic is sportBall
	- - i have no use for sportBall
that and end-stage capitalism 
	- i no longer have any use for "NEXT YEAR'S MODEL LINEUP" 
	- - less still for "coming soon" signs 
our divides are much, much larger than anything that unites
	- i hope to bring something we can all *believe *in
	- and something we can all *work *together towards

if all you see is someone to be pissed at then i guess we are done
	- too white & you're tired of white, how dare god give another great invention to the white man?? 
	- too straight 
	- too liberal - how dare me talk about anything other than "pump more oil" 
if the majority of you *need to hold onto your anger, 
	- i guess all we get is clobbering each other
	- watching to see which billionaire got the new "biggest yacht ever" (*so far)

i don't like any of you, either .. doody birds
	- see how easy that was? anger is the path of leasst resistance

i take it back.. i love all of you, and i love each of you
	- see how much harder that is?
	- - why?? are we honestly all trained for that, now? 
	- if we can all learn to cut it the fk out?? who knows?? but that's our only limit

picture yourself on a mountain-side cubby
	- or on a moving platform, out at sea
	- or another, walking slowly through the forest, barely 10 ft above the canopy

"work" has become something we all dread .. 
	- think we can do better 
	- i want MY jobs to be some of the most exciting in the world .. 
	- i want my jobs to be jobs that people compete for AND pay well 

biden recently visited UAW .. i applaud that.. kinda
	- do better 
	- have partnerships 
	- whether that's just hiring your people, 
	- - or partnering for food, hotel, transpx, entertmx

partnership; 2 rules.. they're both "do the right thing" 
	- pay your taxes (no havens) 
	- pay your people 
	- i want to extend pricing to families & networks
i don't want to hire directly
	- hire through neighborhoods & pay well 
	- OR; hire through companies & pay even better 

no advertising. paid taxes?? paid people?? you're advertised.. & bona fide 

on an even larger scale - i wish i could get leaders of the world to see
	- the iceHalo is arguably the best answer for global warming 
	- if we had this network of buses, each w 1m gallons of water ballast - what does that do for Maui/Greece?
	- for that matter -- what can we do if we suddenly have 1bn gallons of water, available in the skies?? 

ready to connect w those who believe in more .. or are at least prepared to try 
i don't need to hear about 
	- the many ways that it would be better if we followed old paths 
	- there'll be challenges
	- i talk funny 

progression of story - look away 
	- add a "story" to the story .. something like war of the worlds of old - something for the whole world to get behind 
	- huge company, w space elevator & a regular traffic into space 
	- medium size company, w buses
	- small business, a dozen parks few hundred flying RVs
	- derail drumpf
no matter where this lands; it's better than the story i'm living right now
i hope to connect w others who are done w the story of today's status quo

set sights to the farthest point
	- we don't get there. i'm sorry
	- but honestly; wouldn't you rather be *anywhere along *that spectrum.. 
	- compared to the trajectory we all seem to be on, with this one

my name is jeff deremer 

about me ? 
	- zombie, dead at birth, technically a lich .. fkn weird, right?
	- - nikki sixx & i have that in common -- kickstart my heart, indeed 
	- son of a whore (few stories, i've heard them, too) 
	- - you don't get to assume i'll be a sellout, no my mind is not for rent to any god or government
	- - i also don't like hearing 'the system works for white people'.. 
	- nephew / namesake of a murdered man 
	- high school flunkie 
	- teenage runaway 
	- 3 of 4 girls => valedictorian 
	- - s.o. now is PhD in Psych, top in class 
	- or.. just a kid who didn't see the stop sign, and ran straight into destiny, coming on at 60 mph
	- all i keep inside, isn't on the label 

all that and we are going to peel back the veil of time?? 

i like this story .. 
i think we can do big things with this story 
i hope we can get started .. soon
