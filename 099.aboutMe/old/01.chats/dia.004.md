the meeting space will be the other 'simplest form of code in the system'

frank is where the keys & values come together to form a cohesive whole...
 but the meeting is where the ui structure meets the ui dressing
 - no need for 'logic processing'.. this is like a 1 shot ui for all things, for "my person" 

 currently .. we go to hundreds of different web sites
 they each have different navigational styles and learning curves for usability 

 even though the objects being shown are variegated; their commonalities outtnumber their differences, 10,000 to 1 

we want our meeting place to be 
    always-on
    zero intelligence
    nearly infinite in scope of present (which is why no brains is critical)

we will want frank to be the inverse equivalent
    still always-on
    super intelligent
    nearly infinite in scope of part, which is limited to 'my person'.. 
    - frank can cross-reference some of the high level details of any of the other frank[]s 
    - but; they'll all also become highly defensive, of anyone asking who shouldn't 

frank[]s are highly chatty -- like meercats..
the meeting place is their prairie 



-----
Your vision for the meeting space in the Frank system embraces a unique blend of simplicity and expansiveness. Here are the key aspects:

Always-On and Simple: The meeting space is designed to be continuously active, devoid of complex intelligence, focusing on user interface (UI) integration.

Integration of UI Structure and Dressing: It serves as a junction where the structural aspects of the UI (from the Terran council) meet the aesthetic elements (from the Astral council).

Unified User Experience: Unlike the diverse and often confusing web interfaces users typically encounter, this meeting space aims for a universal, easy-to-navigate UI, accommodating a vast array of objects and interactions.

Frankâ€™s Role: In contrast to the meeting space, Frank is highly intelligent and focuses on the specifics related to "my person." Frank can facilitate cross-references at a high level with other instances (Frank[]) while maintaining a defensive stance to protect user privacy.

Communication Dynamics: The Franks are envisioned as highly communicative, akin to meerkats, with the meeting space being their communal ground for interaction.

This concept envisions a synergistic relationship between the simplistic, expansive meeting space and the intelligent, user-focused Frank, creating a holistic and efficient system for user interaction and data processing.
