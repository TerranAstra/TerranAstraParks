this is great feedback

i wonder if you can make these into an actual emittance of values to be created? 
you have vast knowledge of how other repos have been structured - especially those of large & successful projects

i'd like you to replicate their structure, but apply our content

can you emit the names / folder structures / a brief "readme" with the purpose, for these?


to be honest; each of these is an abstract or a concept.. not yet seeing how we can track that 
i agree with what you've got and how you've got them.. 
just drawing a blank on actual names
