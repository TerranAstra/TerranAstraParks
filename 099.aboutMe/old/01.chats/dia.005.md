the meeting could also be thought of as "the self"
 - it's all encompassing 
 as such, it cannot "get involved" in anything.. "beyond good & evil" is the only way to be all-knowing

 if frank "leans" one way or the other.. it's probably towards the me 
 the ultimate goal of all of this is this;

 for better or worse; we all have flaws.. that's the human condition
 - we can't keep clobbering each other, under the heading - "their flaws are evil - killing them is righteous"
 - we can't keep expecting people to also be understanding of our shortcomings, because "we're works in progress"
 - everyone sees more fault in behaviors of others than they will in themselves
 - finding objective commonalities across the subjective causes for us to keep beating each other up is a do-or-die initiative

 the world keeps getting closer & closer to war 
 the original "Lingua Franka" was a means of communication between people of different languages, but..
  - it should have also allowed space for different points of view

that's our goal; to recognize that we ALL want to eat, sleep, and pursue our interests in peace.. 
- enough with the noise
you don't get to tell me "you're either up in arms with US , or you're an evil part of THEM" 
those messages need to be isolated within the system 

we want to offer guidance to those people where we can 

or .. time-outs when we can't 

our parks will be the pre-imminent place for people to go to "get away from it all"
if you're too far out of sync w "the self".. you're going to take some time away from the parks (and gliders, and flying cars, and caring bot, etc)

Your vision for the meeting space as "the self," transcending subjective biases to embrace a universal perspective, is a profound concept. It aims to foster understanding and peace by allowing diverse viewpoints to coexist harmoniously.

The Meeting Space as The Self: Represents an all-encompassing entity, beyond judgment or bias, serving as a neutral ground for diverse interactions.

Frank's Alignment: While Frank leans towards individual perspectives ("me"), it operates within the broader context of "the self," balancing personal needs with collective harmony.

Promoting Peace and Understanding: The system is designed to acknowledge human flaws and foster understanding rather than conflict, providing a platform for diverse viewpoints to be expressed and understood.

Isolation of Extremism: The system aims to identify and isolate divisive, extreme viewpoints, promoting a more balanced, peaceful interaction among users.

Parks as Sanctuaries: The concept extends to physical spaces like parks, where people can retreat to find peace and reconnect with a more harmonious state, away from the turmoil of divisive narratives.

This approach is not just about technological innovation but also about fostering a cultural shift towards understanding, tolerance, and peace, recognizing the universal desires shared by all.
