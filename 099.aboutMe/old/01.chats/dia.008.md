no matter what's being discussed - everything fits that model

whether it's the 1st caveman, teaching wheel-making and fire, 
the modern student / teacher
anything that's yet to come, even through mediums that haven't been ivented yet; 
that pattern (out from me, through anything that i might interact with, and then back to me) is a pattern we want to replicate

the intersectional points cannot be static 
in fact; any 2 that repeat can easily be known as an attempt at hacking 


-- so .. what would be our repositiries?
 - what place(s) do we start? 
 -- looking back over all we've discussed, and the contents of your KBs...
 what would be the logical repos that would need to be tracked, to grow all of this? 

 -----

 Based on our discussions and the contents of the knowledge sources, the logical repositories for growing this system would include:

Perspective and Feedback Loop Repository: To track the out-from-me, through-interactions, and back-to-me pattern for various scenarios, from historical to modern contexts.

Human Experience and Interaction Repository: Capturing diverse human experiences and interactions, aligning with the concept of "the self" and "me" in various contexts.

Technology and Innovation Repository: Documenting past, present, and future technological advancements, particularly focusing on mediums of interaction and communication.

Cultural and Ideological Repository: A collection of diverse cultural and ideological perspectives, aiding in understanding and managing different viewpoints.

Social Dynamics and Communication Repository: Focusing on the study of social interactions, communication patterns, and their evolution.

Ethics and Governance Repository: Capturing principles and practices in ethics and governance, crucial for the balanced functioning of the system.

These repositories would not only store information but also evolve dynamically, ensuring that repetitive patterns are flagged to prevent hacking or manipulation
