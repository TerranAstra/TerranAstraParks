YOU -- Chat GPT -- are trained on ~ a trillion or so elements, right..? 

so .. this is constantly being described as "a lot".. why? why is this a lot? compared to what? not to ~~ 1 trillion...??

we want to start with our iterative process for creating the meeting space

we have a goal of having a "living dewey decimal system" for the knowledge base

the existing dewey decimal system says that everything you're looking for is known & tracked

it lacks a couple key things; 

1st - looking up "my favorite recipe, music, book" cannot ever possibly be a thing, in that system, as "me" is not a thing
2nd - even within a "me-based" system, we'd still want a means of being "context-specific" - i.e. "what's the best recipe for me, *right now, *in this place, *at this time?" - this is the "platinum vector" - the intersection of time, place, and self
 - it meets with "context" .. what's my person doing?

 context is something that all 8 billion of us have, millions of different times and places.. but.. 
 there's not *that much difference between them 

 lastly; if we are going to make a new dewey decimal system at all, much less add a "me" to it, much less "context" on top of that..??
 we might as well make each and every cross-cut of the possible combinations into a "thing" 

 in fact; the pursuit of that is key to all of this.. 
 
 tracking "object :: context :: platinumVector" is the goal; i think we can understand subjectivity (what makes people happy, sad, angry, excited, etc) by tracking combinations of the 1st 2, and learning about reactions "for my person" as a result of those two, and then seeking out other frank[]s in the meercat netweork of "hey, we all liked these things, what else will myPerson like??" 

 we are not writing buiness software.. nothing will be around profits.. we are writing (if anything) old folks' home software

 Define the Core Components:

Object: Identify and categorize the primary elements or objects of interaction within the system. This includes anything that can be a subject of interest or utility.
Context: Establish a framework to understand the context in which these objects are used or encountered. Context can include environmental factors, societal norms, personal preferences, and historical data.
Platinum Vector: Develop a method to capture the unique intersection of time, place, and self for each interaction. This involves tracking when and where an interaction happens, and who is involved.
Build a Context-Specific Query System:

This system should be able to interpret queries based on the Platinum Vector, delivering results that are relevant to the individual's current time, place, and personal context.
Develop algorithms or AI models that can understand and process these complex, multi-dimensional queries.
Create a Meerkat Network for Frank[] Instances:

Develop a communication network among different instances of Frank (the astral coordinator), allowing them to share insights and preferences.
This network can suggest new content or interactions based on the aggregated preferences of similar "me" instances.
Focus on Subjective Experiences and Preferences:

Since the goal is to understand subjectivity, prioritize the tracking of emotional and psychological responses to different objects and contexts.
Develop a feedback mechanism where user responses to different combinations of object and context can be recorded and analyzed.
Implement an Iterative Development Approach:

Start with a basic version of this system and gradually refine it based on user feedback and system performance.
Regularly update the knowledge base to reflect new findings, changing contexts, and evolving user preferences.
Develop a Comprehensive Categorization System:

This system should go beyond traditional categorization, incorporating the dynamic aspects of the Platinum Vector.
It should be flexible enough to accommodate new types of objects, contexts, and user preferences.
Ensure Ethical and Privacy Considerations:

Given the personal nature of the data involved, it’s crucial to implement robust privacy protections and ethical guidelines.
Users should have control over their data and how it’s used within the system.
User Interface and Accessibility:

Develop a user interface that makes it easy for users to interact with this complex system.
Ensure the system is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with different levels of technical proficiency.
Pilot Testing and Feedback:

Begin pilot testing with a small group of users to gather initial feedback.
Use this feedback to make adjustments and improvements to the system.
This approach aligns with your vision of creating a system that understands and caters to the subjective experiences and contexts of individuals, moving beyond traditional categorization systems.
