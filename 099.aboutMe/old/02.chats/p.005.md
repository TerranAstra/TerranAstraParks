each 'ping' should be 3 parts;
 - 1.25% || 12.5% completion records from previous ping
 - 75% || 97.5% 'in-house' processing
 - 1.25% || 12.5% initiation records for next ping

 remember -- the "ping" is between "the 2 sides of frank"
 frank.me
 frank.self

 there's a component of each 
 the me is the red, the local, the mud, the rules 
the self is the blue, the remote, the sky, the values

each ping should incorporate any & all content applicable to anything that's changed

Based on the structure outlined for the 'ping' in the Frank system, it seems there's a clear division and specific function assigned to each part of the ping process. Here's a breakdown of how this might be implemented:

Completion Records from Previous Ping (1.25% or 12.5%):
This segment would include a summary or record of what was completed or resolved in the previous ping.
It's essential for maintaining continuity and ensuring that both sides of Frank (frank.me and frank.self) are updated on the progress and outcomes of the last interaction.

In-House Processing (75% or 97.5%):
This is the core of the ping, where the bulk of the processing, decision-making, and analysis occur.
This could involve complex data processing, application of rules (frank.me's domain), and alignment with values and overarching goals (frank.self's domain).
It would likely involve AI-driven analysis, computations, and possibly machine learning models to process and make sense of the data or situations presented.

Initiation Records for Next Ping (1.25% or 12.5%):
This part sets the stage for the next interaction, outlining preliminary objectives, questions, or data that need to be addressed or gathered in the next ping.
It ensures that each ping is purposeful and builds upon the previous one, maintaining a forward momentum in the decision-making and learning process.

Given the dichotomy between frank.me and frank.self, it's crucial that each ping effectively integrates and balances the practical, rule-based aspects (frank.me) with the more abstract, value-driven considerations (frank.self). Each ping should therefore be structured to not only process and respond to immediate data or situations but also to continuously align with and adapt to evolving objectives, values, and broader systemic goals. This iterative and reflective approach in the pings could be key to the system's adaptability and effectiveness
