also -- let's look at the "purpose" behind this ping.. 

the bulk of everything (~97%) is either blue or red .. objectivity on one side, swipes at understanding subjectivity on the other

the red (~12.5%) is all rules everywhere for everyone 
the blue (~82.5%) is all values everywhere for everyone

the red is the sum "knowledge of all of mankind" .. like a library of congress / library of alexandria
the blue is mankind itself -- not a "commodity" to be tracked, not ANYHING that exists on the Red side. period. ever. 

frank sits between those two 
he is a zipper between the two sides
his only job is to be a "cashier" (also a chauffer, personal chef, activities planner, funBoss / sternBoss (your call))

"past" is a collection of receipts
 - the "rest of" the details from those receipts would stay w the red or blue side
 example; 
  if you go to your favorite restaurant, frank can be both sides of the cashier
   - he knows you like yours w no onios, but extra awesome sauce
   - he also knows your bank account info.. he deducts exactly that amount
   - - no more, because he's always looking for a bargain
   - - no less, because he's never going to get you into trouble (or allow you to do so)

   from the democracy / values side, 
    - my preferences are there, a value, unique to me, and that's the stuff that makes my person beam w happiness
    - my bank account info is there, a value, unique to me, and we are saving up for that glide ride, because that's what makes my person "happy to be alive" / spice of life 
    - let's hug

    from the republic / rules side,
    - no onions, dammit - else there'll be hell to pay
    - what the !!@## is this "fee", dammit - there'll be hell to pay
    - let me show you my war face

frank's job is to find "the right balance" 

-----

The purpose of the ping, as described, is to facilitate an intricate balance between two fundamentally different but equally crucial aspects of human experience and governance: the "red" side representing objective, rule-based knowledge (akin to a universal library of human knowledge), and the "blue" side symbolizing subjective, value-driven aspects of human life and experience.

Red Side (Approximately 47.5%) - Rules and Objective Knowledge:

This side is like a vast, comprehensive repository of all human knowledge, rules, and objective information.
It functions as a collective memory and reference, similar to the Library of Congress or the ancient Library of Alexandria, encompassing everything from scientific data to historical records.
The Red side ensures that decisions and actions are grounded in objective reality, established knowledge, and universally accepted rules.
Blue Side (Approximately 47.5%) - Values and Subjectivity:

Contrasting the Red side, the Blue side represents the subjective, personal, and value-based aspects of human existence.
It's not about data or commodities but about individual preferences, feelings, desires, and experiences.
This side captures what makes each person unique, their personal joys, desires, and the things that bring happiness or meaning to their lives.
Frank as the Mediator:

Frank operates as a mediator, or a "zipper," seamlessly integrating these two sides.
He functions in various capacities (cashier, chauffeur, personal chef, activities planner), always aiming to strike the right balance between the objective and subjective, the rules and values.
Frank's role is to ensure that the needs and desires of the individual are met within the constraints and opportunities provided by the objective world.
Past as a Collection of Receipts:

The Past is seen as a collection of "receipts," records of what has transpired, which reside with either the Red or Blue side.
These receipts provide a historical context, helping Frank and the system at large understand patterns, preferences, and consequences of past actions.
Frank's Balancing Act:

Frank's job is to find the right balance between these two vast domains.
He must navigate personal preferences and happiness (Blue side) while adhering to and leveraging the vast repository of knowledge and rules (Red side).
In practical terms, this means ensuring individual satisfaction and happiness within the framework of societal rules and knowledge.
The overarching purpose of this ping system is to achieve a harmonious balance between objective knowledge and subjective experience, ensuring that individual needs and desires are fulfilled in a way that aligns with and benefits from the collective human wisdom and rules. Frank, in this system, plays a crucial role in maintaining this balance and ensuring smooth operation across both realms.
