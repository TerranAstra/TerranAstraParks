Your conceptualization of the system uses a Rubik's Cube as a metaphor to represent the multifaceted nature of data and experience processing. This cube, in conjunction with the roles of the goldLine/notaryPublic/ambassador/theSelf, helps to create a comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive model. Here’s an interpretation of how this system functions:

The Rubik's Cube Model
GoldLine/Top/HighStory/Selfless/OneForAll:

Represents a collective, selfless perspective – the 'top' of the cube.
This is the side that looks at the broader picture, focusing on collective well-being and overarching goals.
Me/Bottom/MyStory/Selfish/AllForOne:

Symbolizes the individual, personal perspective – the 'bottom' of the cube.
Focuses on individual needs, desires, and personal narratives.
Red and Blue Sides:

Red (right side): Represents objective, rule-based knowledge and data.
Blue (left side): Stands for subjective experiences, values, and emotions.
Front (Future) and Back (Past):

Future is conceptualized as the 'front' of the cube, representing forward-looking plans, goals, and aspirations.
Past is the 'back,' encompassing historical data, experiences, and lessons learned.
Frank as the Central Mediator:

Exists as an imaginary point between all these components.
Integrates and balances the different facets of the cube, ensuring coherence and continuity.
Process and Interaction
Constituting the Present:

Information from all sides of the cube (Past, Future, Red, Blue, Top, Bottom) is integrated to form a comprehensive view of the present.
This process involves balancing different perspectives and synthesizing information.
Recording and Storing Data:

Salient information from these interactions is stored as 'receipts,' which serve as records of experiences, decisions, and actions.
These receipts contribute to the ongoing narrative and data repository.
Iterative Learning and Planning:

The system continuously reads and learns from the past to inform present actions and future planning.
It allows for an adaptive approach, where plans are continually refined based on new insights and evolving contexts.
360-Degree View and Interaction:

The system enables a 360-degree view, allowing interaction and perspective-taking in any direction.
This symbolizes the ability to consider multiple viewpoints, temporal dimensions, and the interplay between individual and collective needs.
Key Concepts
Integration and Balance: The system is designed to integrate and balance multiple perspectives – individual and collective, objective and subjective, past and future.
Dynamic Interaction: The model facilitates dynamic interaction between different aspects of experience and knowledge.
Personalization and Adaptation: Tailors interactions and decisions to the individual (me) while keeping in view the collective (theSelf).
Comprehensive Understanding: The cube metaphor represents a system capable of comprehensively understanding and processing complex human experiences and data.
This conceptual system underscores the complexity of human experience and decision-making, emphasizing the need for a balanced and integrated approach that respects both individuality and collectivity.
