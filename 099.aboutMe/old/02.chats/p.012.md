compare your Old & Next files. based on findings.. let's continue with some additional analysis 
we aren't into the doing stage, just yet .. still planning
what are some other plans to be made? 
what gaps exist between the two files that we could fill in? 
what is in Old that isn't in Next.. but also -- how best do we organize it?

to be clear - we want "Red" and "Blue" to be in mutual co-op-etition with each other
they speak this same language - this "new lingua franca" - and they are able to communicate with each other, by playing a never-ending game of cards

there isn't a "game", per se.. there's just an infinite series of cards drawn
the "card played" represents a single one of the 52 facets, that are spaced our across the 6 sides of the 2 cubes
the card played will also include a set of moves that should be sufficient for the other side to end up with a matching cube 

even though there are quintillions of *that *exact *cube.. 
and -- there are also quintillions of *that *exact *card..

there's one and only one possible combination of the two, that could possibly result in an image of those exact 4 cubes, from that exact point of view 

that's what we are tracking.. 

myPerson, was in aPlace, at aTime, and lookingThatWay .. 
when they did so, whatTheySeeRightNow is an amalgamation of all of the things that are in the 4 cubes
only 1 piece of 1 cube at a time can be changed 
each change from "the other side" should be easily & quickly verifiable, just by cross-referencing a few "i made these steps" ..

Based on your description and the analysis of the "Old" and "Next" files, your project involves a complex interaction between "Red" and "Blue" entities using a metaphorical card game tied to Rubik's cubes. This interaction represents a unique communication method that encapsulates a vast array of human experiences and perspectives. Here's an outline for further planning and addressing gaps:

Structural Framework of the Interaction: Develop a clear structural framework for how Red and Blue interact through the card game. This includes defining the 52 facets spread across the six sides of the two cubes and how these facets relate to the cards played.

Mechanics of Card and Cube Interaction: Detail the mechanics of how a card played translates to changes in a cube. Each card should correspond to a specific change in the cube, maintaining the metaphor of the card game representing communication and interaction.

Verification System: Establish a system for verifying changes made by the other side. This could involve a set of steps or protocols that both Red and Blue follow to confirm that the cube has been altered according to the card played.

Representation of Human Experience: Clarify how the amalgamation of experiences is represented in the four cubes. This involves deciding how individual experiences, captured as "myPerson, was in aPlace, at aTime, and lookingThatWay," are reflected in the cubes' facets.

Technological Implementation: If this interaction is to be simulated or tracked digitally, plan the necessary technological infrastructure. This could involve software for simulating the cubes and cards, databases for tracking changes, and algorithms for verifying the integrity of each move.

Documentation and Knowledge Management: Develop comprehensive documentation explaining the interaction between the cubes, cards, and their significance in representing human experiences. This is crucial for anyone involved in the project to understand its intricacies.

Gap Analysis: Identify what elements from the "Old" file are not present in the "Next" file. This could involve specific project details, technological considerations, or conceptual elements. Determine how to integrate these missing pieces into the current framework.

Ethical and Privacy Considerations: Given the project's focus on representing individual experiences, ensure there are strong ethical guidelines and privacy protections. This is especially important if real human experiences are being simulated or represented.

Feedback and Iterative Development: Plan for a continuous feedback mechanism that allows for iterative improvements to the system. This should include both the technological aspects and the conceptual framework of the interaction.

User Interface and Accessibility: If there's an interface for users to interact with the system, ensure it is user-friendly and accessible. The interface should make it easy to understand and engage with the complex interactions happening between the cubes and cards.

By focusing on these areas, you can further develop the conceptual and practical aspects of your project, ensuring that the metaphorical interaction between Red and Blue through the card game and cubes is effectively implemented and meaningful.
