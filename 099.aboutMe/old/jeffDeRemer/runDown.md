great great grand-son of a foot-soldier that lived
need to look into stories i remember of great-great grand uncle that was an inventor of something -- 'deremer fort'?

nephew & namesake of a murdered man .. that could be an interesting factor in our story

born in an american naval base in rota, cadiz, spain 
my mother would tell me i was her 'miracle baby' - 
** "i was prounounced dead 3x at birth, and then coded", she'd say. she begged them for just one more.. here i am
i've got no way to prove any of this.. unless that hospital keeps track of that level of detail at all, let alone for 50+ years

my father was out at sea, when i was born & delayed;
my mother's poorly-timed departure, left her known as 'persona non grata' to the nation of italy
- not necessarily a factor.. again.. the series of improbabilities

back to the states by 74 - small town in easter pa 

poor on both sides, but - i remember some stories from times w my mom.. 
i am not ashamed of me, any longer.. this wasn't *ME* .. it was my environment
an environment which, if left unchecked, appears poised to get a whole lot worse, for many
i am the son of a whore. i do not wear that like a tie.. this is a realization i have had - i think i am a lot of different things.. that's one

'love bug' was my nickname.. i am throwing that out there for a purpose
i think there's something really really big happening
i loved my mom very deeply
that was shattered
you'll hopefully know the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath
i am not a psychopath.. those are born
i am not a sociopath.. those are made.. for me - that started in 1980
more later

a key event happened on/around my 13th birthday
i didn't see the stop sign
by the time i saw the car, it was coming at me at about 60mph, merely inches away
"Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of governmentâ€¦"
idiot kids who run headlong into a destiny that they couldn't discuss with anyone is even less of one
i do not expect a single person to believe a word of that statement 
-- but i have always said 'i am arguably the most devout agnostic the world could have possibly ever produced'
i did not come away from that with any particular slant toward one religion or other.. i can see parallels to parts of nearly all

i want to throw in something that's odd.. again, no proof unless there are detailed records
multiple teachers at school stopped class - in the middle of the lesson - to express something
.. ostenibly *to* me, but .. they did this in front of the classes
it happened several times.. they weren't "normal accolades" .. but again if there aren't any records

another statistical improbability; 3 of the 4 girls i dated in high school, were their respective class' valedictorians
i mean - i guess anyone could pursue that qualifier ex post facto, but.. i didn't.. i was just a kid.. 
i knew what i liked.. think about how improbable that *already* is, but

i didn't graduate with my class
i failed english, with it senior year 
"flunkie" -- that could be an interesting thing on its own, but .. 
what flunkie can claim 3/4 valedictorians...?

i ran away over and over. 
once at 10 - i remember her nails carving into my face later that very night
once at 16 - bike chained to my ass, only made it as far as the bronx
left for good at 17
winter of 89
