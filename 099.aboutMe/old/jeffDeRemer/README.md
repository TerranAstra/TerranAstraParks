nobody likes a backstory .. but we need to know this is someone believable.. that'll need some _why_, definitely.. 

---
I've always wanted flying cars (Doesn't _Everybody?!_)

Everything that follows is an attempt to achieve that 



--- 
also - i have kinda 'had it' .. if you live primarily for being extreme; please exit through the gift shop...

something about a `contract with humanity`.. 

show me the guy who's willing to sign a `Last Will & Testament` that leaves everything* to everyone else (* = i am not promising to be destitute.. just promising thati have no use for the billionaire's 'yacht club' and proceeds are for this vague & nebulous thing called 'the future', to which a majority of us will contribute) and i'll sign on.. meantime; most business owners seem to inevitably give in to the need to be a billionaire.. i want to write it in ahead of time; PLEASE don't let me become that person..

`Bill of Rights` -> Meet `Expectations & Responsibilities List`

So many people throw "i got rights!" around.. 

When rights are used by one person to stomp all over another person, those rights should probably include a measure of responsibilities. i cannot enforce that on anyone.. but maybe we create those expectations as conditions to access-levels / pay-outs 

 - quit being a jerk

 - stop worrying so much about `them`.. i know "them" .. "they" are my friends. yes, they think different than you. everyone has to stop screaming and being so determined to control everyone else's life

 - kids.. it's difficult seeing some of what kids are being exposed to, these days. from all over. i believe kids should be kids.. 
 
 - `three centuries club` .. [“A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit.” — Greek Proverb](https://medium.com/@RickSnyder/a-society-grows-great-when-old-men-plant-trees-in-whose-shade-they-shall-never-sit-3a670d939a64#:~:text=Top%20highlight-,%E2%80%9CA%20society%20grows%20great%20when%20old%20men%20plant%20trees%20in,never%20sit.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Greek%20Proverb) .. Let's be this.. that means one main thing we all need to remember; in 3 centuries - whatever it was we were screaming about.. it doesn't matter, anymore. not in the slightest. it's gone. let that go. ok? look at the waterfalls. the ponds. dig in the dirt. work in a million new horizons. try a million new jobs. meet a billion new people. a new sunset each evening. all is ask...? quit being willfully jerks to each other. 

 i believe lots of us have kinda _become_ this way, lately.. 
  - nothing to look forward to!
  - surrounded by so so many messages of anger, hate, 'be pissed!'

 - love of carl sagan

'we are a means by which the universe might know itself'.. 

i've come to feel like that is actually maybe a 'call to action', not a 'destination' we've reached..

 it feels like everyone _seems_ nice when we first meet them on the world stage, but then the secrets come out, also 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' ..

the story about out-selling not only the rest of the store, but nearly the entire south-east region in an attempt to get to australia.. 

i hated that i had that inside me.. i quit..

i am ready -- with extreme conditions -- to explore that, again. there may not be any of it left.. but let's find out
