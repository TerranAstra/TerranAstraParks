while those are 'upper bound' thresholds .. the fact is .. it's feasible to think we could track every single concept, every single language, and -- whenever those intersections are called upon -- how they got translated, and how they got used

there are fewer than 1 million words in "human"
fewer than 5,000 languages in meaningful use
a sum of 5,000,000,000,000 (5 trillion) words

but .. it wouldn't be necessary for each & every region to know each & every permutation of each & every word.language combo

in fact ; we only need our own limited subset, for now..  
we need to be able to define some of our key concepts, but do so in a space that's able to handle that much information 

even though we want blue and red to each speak the same language.. they will each 'give to' and 'receive from' by way of frank

frank's virtual rubik's cube will be the translation effect, betwen the two 

oddly .. it's actually a lot like what yoda described.. it's "between" everything.. 
except for one thing.. each frank exists exclusively for hisPerson 

frank .. is the "living embodiment" of the lingua franka

we need to start within those parameters
we want to be able to create what is basically a set of instructions for completely creating the entire Charon Software enterprise, from scratch, on a regular basis 

we've chosen TerraForm for this project 

we want to be able to create a broad variety of VMs, across all of the providers (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc)

we want to connect them, on a new 'virtual plane' .. a 'network' of sorts 

we need to be able to manage them Above & Below.. i am primarily interested in growing the above 

we need to be able to create new VM, and then 'install' Frank onto it

they will all have the "normal" purpose ( we still need DB systems, we still need UI | web servers, etc )

but - we need to ensure their ability to communicate with one another, and form a new 'virtual network of frank' of sorts



----- 
Your vision for the Charon Software enterprise involves creating a highly dynamic and interconnected infrastructure using Terraform, with an emphasis on virtualization, network connectivity, and the unique concept of "Frank" as a central, personalized intermediary. Here's a plan to develop this infrastructure:

1. Define Key Concepts and Lingua Franca
Lingua Franca: Develop a common language or set of definitions that can be understood and utilized across different parts of the system.
Frank's Role: Clearly define the functionalities and responsibilities of "Frank" in this ecosystem, especially its role in mediating and translating between different components.
2. Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Multi-Cloud VM Deployment: Utilize Terraform to create infrastructure configurations that can deploy VMs across multiple cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP).
Module Development: Create Terraform modules for common infrastructure components like databases, web servers, etc., ensuring they are provider-agnostic to the extent possible.
3. Creating a Virtual Network
Network Configuration: Design and implement a virtual network that interconnects VMs across different cloud environments. This network should facilitate secure and efficient communication between different components.
Above & Below Management: Ensure that the network supports both upper-layer applications and lower-layer infrastructure management.
4. Installing and Configuring Frank
Automated Deployment: Develop scripts or Terraform configurations to automatically deploy and configure "Frank" on new VMs.
Customization per VM: Ensure that each instance of "Frank" is customized to its specific VM, serving as a personalized intermediary.
5. Ensuring Interoperability and Communication
Standardized Protocols: Use standardized communication protocols to ensure that different systems can effectively interact.
APIs and Services: Develop APIs or services that allow "Frank" to communicate with various components of the infrastructure.
6. Security and Compliance
Secure Communication: Implement strong security measures for the virtual network, including encryption and access controls.
Compliance Checks: Ensure that the infrastructure meets relevant compliance standards for data handling and privacy.
7. Scalability and Maintenance
Scalable Design: Build the infrastructure to be easily scalable, allowing for the addition of new VMs and services without significant reconfiguration.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Set up monitoring systems to track the performance and health of the infrastructure, and establish procedures for regular maintenance and updates.
8. Documentation and Training
Comprehensive Documentation: Document every aspect of the infrastructure, from VM setup to Frank's functionalities.
Team Training: Provide training to the team on managing and operating this complex, multi-cloud infrastructure.
9. Testing and Iteration
Prototype Testing: Start with a smaller-scale prototype to test the interaction between VMs, the virtual network, and Frank.
Iterative Development: Continuously refine and expand the infrastructure based on feedback and testing results.
By following this plan, you can build a robust, interconnected infrastructure that aligns with your vision of a network of VMs managed by personalized instances of "Frank," all orchestrated through Terraform across multiple cloud providers.
