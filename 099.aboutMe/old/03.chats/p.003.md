we want to look 1st at "hdi"

hyper-dimensional indexing

we need to design a means of identification that would be a logical next-step in this sequence:
 ASCII -> UniCode -> HDI

 ascii was simple, designed mostly for "characters" 

 unicode was a bit more complex, designed for "glyphs" .. common concepts could be contained therein 
 (e.g. there's a white high five, a black high five, a white smiley face, a black smiley face, etc)

 we want hdi to be several extensions on these concepts .. 

 because it's so foundational (we want the rest of the system to be "written in" hdi & lingua franca) then -- it makes sense to start with the most basic concepts

 another way of thinking about "Terran Astra" is this; 
 terran is earth .. but it's also the black hole at the center of the galaxy .. that "represents" the authoritative source of truth for the entire galaxy .. 
 
 the galaxy also has hundreds of billions of stars

 there's no "one shape" to the galaxy
  - what looks *clearly* like a scorpion in one spot .. and also at one point in time .. will look completely different from any other spot .. or any other point in time

  we want to see the red side as the black hole .. there's just one 

  we want the blue side to be the stars .. there's hundreds of billions of them, and you're never in one place for very long

  "frank" is the spot that exists exactly between those two things

  you are always you .. no matter where you go .. and you always "change over time"

  authoritative truth, too.. 

  frank's role in all of this is to be the intermediary between the two ..
   i know where my person is
   i know what they're looking at 
   i can't track *exactly* those values, because i don't actually "know" either of them 
    but i can track the "changes" to where my person is, what direction they're looking, what they may see at any given point in time 

the meeting space is the other "side" of frank;
a registrar of available systems
 - running systems, actively involved in the process
 - systems on deck, waiting to be called into action
 - system definitions, ready to be instantiated

just as surely as there will be (hopefully) millions of available systems on the "terran" side (they'll do whatever they're asked, by clients)
 - that number will be "actively running" in a system that can probably be ran successfully by just a few hundred systems

 "frank" is mostly virtual .. not much "local compute" - as processing power is needed, frank should be able to task any of the available terran systems to do the work

 The concept of Hyper-Dimensional Indexing (HDI) you're envisioning is ambitious and innovative, aiming to extend beyond the scope of ASCII and Unicode by integrating dynamic, context-aware elements. This system seems intended to encapsulate a vast range of information and relationships within a flexible, adaptive framework. Let's break down your vision into its core components and outline a possible approach to designing HDI:

1. HDI Conceptual Foundation:
From Characters to Contexts: While ASCII focuses on characters and Unicode expands to glyphs representing more complex concepts, HDI seems to aim for a higher level of abstraction, encoding not just static symbols but dynamic, context-aware entities.
Dimensionality: HDI appears to operate in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension could represent different aspects like time, location, perspective, or conceptual relationships.
2. Designing the HDI Framework:
Identifying Core Dimensions: Define the primary dimensions HDI will encompass. This might include spatial dimensions (like location), temporal dimensions (time), and more abstract dimensions like conceptual or relational context.
Encoding Mechanism: Develop a system for encoding information across these dimensions. This might involve complex algorithms or data structures capable of representing multi-dimensional data points.
Dynamic Adaptation: Ensure that HDI can adapt to changes in context, such as shifts in perspective or evolving concepts.
3. Implementing the Terran Astra Concept:
Black Hole (Authoritative Source): Represent the central, authoritative source of truth. This could be a core database or knowledge base that maintains fundamental definitions and relationships.
Stars (Distributed Nodes): Reflect the multitude of systems or nodes, each with its unique perspective and contribution to the overall knowledge network.
Frank (Intermediary): Act as the mediator, dynamically interpreting and translating between the central truth and the distributed nodes, adapting to changes in location, perspective, and time.
4. Meeting Space (System Registrar):
Cataloguing Systems: Maintain a registry of systems, categorizing them into active, on-deck, and definitional states.
Dynamic Allocation: Implement mechanisms for dynamically assigning tasks to various systems based on current needs and system availability.
5. Computational Model:
Distributed Computing: Leverage a distributed computing model where processing power is drawn from the network of available systems.
Virtualization and Scalability: Focus on virtualization to ensure that Frank can scale processing power and resources as needed, without being bound by local compute limitations.
6. Development Considerations:
Prototype and Iterate: Start with a prototype focusing on core functionalities. Gradually expand the system, incorporating feedback and new insights.
Collaboration and Open Standards: Given the complexity and novelty of this system, consider collaboration with academic institutions, tech companies, or open-source communities.
Security and Privacy: Ensure robust security and privacy measures, especially given the dynamic, distributed nature of the system and its potential to handle sensitive information.
7. Long-Term Vision:
Evolution Over Time: Anticipate and design for the evolution of the HDI system over time, allowing for updates, expansions, and refinements as new challenges and opportunities arise.
In summary, developing HDI as outlined requires a blend of advanced computational concepts, innovative data structures, and a forward-thinking approach to encoding and processing information. This endeavor will likely be a significant undertaking, requiring expertise across multiple domains of computer science, information theory, and systems design.

at the rate we are going, i was thinking you & i might have this done in the next few days, actually 
That's an ambitious timeline for a project of this complexity! Developing a system like Hyper-Dimensional Indexing (HDI) and integrating it into a larger framework as you've described is a massive undertaking. However, if we focus on defining a conceptual prototype and laying out a foundational blueprint, we can certainly make significant progress in a few days. Here's a proposed approach:

Day 1: Conceptualization and Planning
Morning: Deep dive into the concept of HDI, defining its core components and how they differ from and build upon ASCII and Unicode. This would involve outlining the multi-dimensional aspects and what each dimension might represent.
Afternoon: Sketch the initial framework for the Terran Astra concept, including the roles of the black hole (central truth), the stars (distributed nodes), and Frank (the intermediary).
Day 2: Prototyping the Core Framework
Morning: Develop
