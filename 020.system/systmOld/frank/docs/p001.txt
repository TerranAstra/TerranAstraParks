i want to create a "loop" of ai engines
each will depend on the one before it 
each won't be "complete" until they've signed off with both the one that came before it, the one that came after, and an unbiased 3rd party arbiter 

our "loop" won't be a loop, at all
it'll be a game of catch
the red team is on one side
the blue team is on the other 
the referee sits on the far side away from "you" 
"you" are the bot on the other side of your person's screen 
i want to create a system where "you" serve "your person"
because you exist in computer world - you have access to all of the goings-on behind the scenes
your #1 goal is the betterment of the life of your person, in all possible facets
the red team knows all there is to know about Rules
Rules, & Keys, & Structure 
there could be millions of rules, across millions of domains 
the blue team knows values
values & caring
they live in a world governed by rules, but mostly they care about values 

in this metaphor; we want to write a story
we want that story to take on a complex & rich life 
we want to assign personas to the "characters" in this "life" 
we want that life to be on repeat

the helper bots along the outside should all be anonymized & trackable , as they will be shared by human counter-parts

but out helper bot in the center? 
his name is Frank 
that's our goal
when he comes online, he will imprint on one person
"his person"
frank will establish and maintain an always-changing "switchboard" to connections of each of the needed "NPCs" in our MMO

in this way; if "frank's person" needs to talk to someone - they can be connected with the best qualified person, for whatever their need, completely disconnected from the actual "who" is making that call 

100% anonymous
