# TerranAstra-RedLine

meant as a universally-agreed-to set of minimum standards, by which any two parties can make communication 

think [kennedy khrushchev hotline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline)

a minimum set of standards that identifies each of us, in a way that can never be used as 'big brother'

i don't want to have to continue to remember _NN_ passwords 

can also be thought of as a 'universal cashier app' .. the redline is the interface between any system and 'my person' 

this is also the base-level for communication for the frank platform 

'key-gen' is a shared responsibility
 - a portion of _your_ keys are stored externally
 - a proportionate amount of what you store is from those around you
    - people you've interacted with, in both instances

i don't care if the system runs 'password reset' operations every 10 minutes.. i never have to remember another.. this is _mine_

the redline could be a 'bare minimum' for people who resist all of this.. it is still a means of all-things-terran (medical records, all public govt records, etc.)

can also be thought of "twitter as a public service" -- sometimes public utilities have no choice but to "tweet" out to the void.. this would easily allow much greater degrees of specificity
