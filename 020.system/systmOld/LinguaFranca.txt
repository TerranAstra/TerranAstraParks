Latin was never a "spoken" language
it was a solution to a probelm - a big problem

misunderstandings have always caused problems
that continues, to this day

The origins of latin stem in an attempt to solve that problem
the 'common tongue'

a codex of combinations
all possible combinations
to language X, from language Z, for copy by language Y 
all "official" communication was only in the common tongue
the shared language
the lingua franca
humanity faces a lot of challenges, right now
all too often - those who know the least, know it the loudest
those whose coices *should be heard - they're drowned out
we want our Lingua Franca to be MUCH much more than merely a communications & translations protocol
to be clear - Frank (the living embodiment of this Lingua Franca) will indeed be the best communications _and the best translations in the world.. but much more importantly - he will be a much-needed "voice" for those who are sometimes not heard .. 
one we all share 
there can only be one of these.. no special favors
as we create Frank .. we need to ensure that all stages of "thought" are democratized
