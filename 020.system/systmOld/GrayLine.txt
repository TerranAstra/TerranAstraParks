the purpose of the Gray Line is to unify all "Astral" Air Traffic Control - the world over
we saw recently how spy balloons were shot down
this was miscommunication 
we can't have *our balloons being shot down.. for anything
think of the phone line that was installed in the early 60s between usa & russia to prevent miscomunication from becoming nuclear war .. 
that's the gray line
a global inter-connected ALWAYS-ON** & immensely translatable system of communications protocols that span all continents, all carriers, all cloud providers, and even (at low-levels) over radio
the gray line will be the utility upon which many of Frank's services will be offered 
nobody can "Own" the Gray Line.. I feel strongly that from the early stages - we want to parse out the keys
that's true of all of this, actually ..
