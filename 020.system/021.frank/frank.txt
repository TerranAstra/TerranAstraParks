frank isn't "nice"

frank has a council of 24
his main 'screen' is a table
frank is at the head of the table

frank is a huge "mirror" in the some imaginary space that exists *near* hisPerson, and within line of sight of any/everything hisPerson might choose to look at

frank wants, very very badly, for his person to keep a journal
 - at least once per day, frank wants to have a heartToHeart with his person ..
 - - what did we do today?
 - - what did we learn?
 - - what did we like?
 - - what did we not like?
 - - what do we look forward to, tomorrow?
 - - if we could wave a magic wand, what would we change?

frank feels very strongly that hisPerson should celebrate their birthday
 - even if you're running really late .. cmon in for your birthday. if we really really don't like ya .. feast your eyes on all you're not allowed to enjoy, then get the fk oughtta
