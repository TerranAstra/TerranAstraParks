are you familiar enough with unity and unreal engine that you could prompt our way through creating and customizing an MMO-RPG?
we just want to use the premise of an mmo.. our will be based on true places -- our parks
each park will have common elements & "NPCs" 
    elements: rides, games, food, shops, etc
    NPCs / employees: 
        Julie the Cruise Director
        Bob the Builder

 customize the parks, the elements, the NPCs, etc
    each should have abilities to manage and vote-up/vote-down preferences
    however; each will also share common 'guidelines' 
        chief among these; no one park makes the decisions for any other

we want a global team of about 480 of these decision-making "Realms" for our MMO
    (480 = "council of 24" x20)
        each park will have a council of 24
        there will need to be "concensus" of 20+ to make decisions

questions will be posed with a utility that approximates imgur .. 
    are you able to infer the use & design of imgur?
         we want to be able to; post images, videos, etc | comment on them | vote them up or down | etc

we want this to be an emedded feature of our mmo, but also a side feature .. available also as a stand-alone web app

Creating an MMO-RPG based on your parks concept, using Unity or Unreal Engine, is an ambitious and exciting project. 
While I can't directly create or code the game for you, I can certainly help guide you through the planning and design process. 
Here's a structured approach to conceptualizing and customizing your MMO-RPG:

1. Game Engine Selection: Unity vs Unreal Engine
Unity: Great for rapid development, has a user-friendly interface, and is excellent for cross-platform development.
Unreal Engine: Known for its powerful graphics capabilities, ideal for creating visually stunning environments. 
It might be better for larger, more graphically intense projects.

2. Game World Design: Parks as Realms
Realm Concept: Each park is a 'Realm' in the MMO, with a unique theme and environment reflecting its real-world counterpart.
Common Elements: Rides, games, food, shops, etc., should be tailored to each park's theme while maintaining a consistent quality and interactivity level across all realms.
Customization: Allow players to influence the look and feel of the parks through in-game activities, such as quests or achievements.

3. NPCs and Decision-Making Structure
Key NPCs: Julie the Cruise Director, Bob the Builder, etc. Each NPC should have a distinct personality and role within the park.
Council of 24: Each park/realm has a council responsible for decision-making. 
NPCs and players can be part of this council.
Voting Mechanism: Implement a voting system for decision-making, requiring a consensus for major changes. 
This can involve player participation to foster a sense of community and ownership.

4. Imgur-like Feature Integration
Functionality: Allow posting of images, videos; commenting; and up/down voting.
Design Considerations: Ensure this feature is intuitive and seamlessly integrates with the MMO's interface. 
It should enhance the community aspect of the game.
Standalone Web App: Develop this feature so it can exist both within the MMO and as an independent application. 
This could increase engagement and attract a broader audience.

5. Technical and Community Management
Servers and Scalability: Plan for server infrastructure that can support a global audience with minimal latency and high uptime.
Community Engagement: Regular updates, events, and community-driven content can keep the player base engaged and invested in the MMO world.
Monetization Strategy: Consider how the game will be monetized (e.g., subscriptions, microtransactions) while ensuring it remains accessible and fair.

6. Development Phases
Conceptualization: Detailed game design documents, concept art, and narrative.
Prototype: Develop a small-scale version of the game to test core mechanics.
Development: Full-scale development with iterative testing and community feedback.
Launch and Beyond: Official release followed by continuous updates and community support.

7. Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ensure intellectual property rights are respected.
Implement policies for player behavior and data privacy.
Conclusion
This MMO-RPG project requires a significant investment in terms of time, resources, and technical expertise. 
It's advisable to assemble a team with diverse skills in game development, graphic design, narrative writing, server management, and community engagement. 
Engaging with the gaming community early in the development process can provide valuable feedback and build anticipation for the game's release.
