i want to be able to interact with at least 1 assistant 
let's start here
- [ ] make an assistant
- [ ] upload files to it
- [ ] ask it a lengthy question, that will require a streaming response handler
- [ ] get a response
- [ ] store information about assistants, questions asked, responses, etc in a repository that can be further used for more analysis
- [ ] repeat
step 1 -- we need to be able to connect to the openAi api server
