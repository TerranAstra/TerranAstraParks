# this is a C# functionalities

# we want to implement a class that can be used to create a new static object, called dataKiosk

# this object will have a method that can be used to read the data from the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to write the data to the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to delete the data from the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to update the data in the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to search the data in the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to sort the data in the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to filter the data in the object

# this object will have a method that can be used to display the data in the object
