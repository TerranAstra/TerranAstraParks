## Registrar
-- 'terran' registrar of available systems
 - azure, aws, gcp, etc
 - connected via
 - - att, verizon, etc

## Clock-Keeper
-- astral registrar of people
- - there is a "home|body" and a "View" / vectors collection
- - - vectors = "in/out" of both "audio/visual" == total of 4 vectors
clock keeper also knows if you're early or late, comparatively .. early = step right up ... late = gotta wait a bit longer

the Concierge sits between these two considerations
