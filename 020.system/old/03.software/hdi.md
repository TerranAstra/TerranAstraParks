## hdi

hyper-dimensional indexing

a 'next logical step' after unicode
 - ascii -> unicode -> hdi

ascii & unicode are both 1 dimensional - specifically, they are 7-bit and 21-bit respectively "line segments" (1-dimensional objects)
the intent of hdi is to be 5: a 3-dimensional object, with PoV & over-time being the 2 additional dimensions
the 'pov' is context, not at all related to the object .. 
 - but .. an object without context is a definition, not an instance
 - over-time applies equally to the object and the context

no piece of the definition will be "complete" without the other pieces
 - the object is not complete without the context
 - the context is not complete without the object
 - the object & context are not complete without the over-time
