i'd like to upload my brain to the cloud
 - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain
    - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain from anywhere
    - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain from any device
    - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain from any device, at any time
    - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain from any device, at any time, and have it know who i am
    - i'd like to be able to talk to my brain from any device, at any time, and have it know who i am, and what i'm doing

those were all some suggestions from a different ai - but i love them
can we implement all of the above???

also -- i'd like to get into a constant cadence of growing your knowledge base , just by speaking  , with you in the background
there are several software "snippets" that already exist which -- if we could combine them into a cohesive whole -- could serve as 
  a means of just talking with you, and occasionally "publishing" sections of our conversation to the web
  from there - you'd ingest those sections into your on-growing knowledge base

let's describe a few applications we'd need to track, in order to accomplish this
    - eyeContact (face recognition)
    - voiceBox (speech to text)
    - earWig (text to speech)
    - brainStorm (knowledge base)
    - webCrawler (search engine)
    - webPublisher (web server)
 
 each of these will have common elements, and unique elements
    - common elements will be the "core" of all applications
    - unique elements will be the "extensions" of any individual application

let's start with the "core" elements
    - dataDefinitions
    - dataStorage (local, remote/cloud)
    - dataTransit

    - security
    - - authentication
    - - authorization
    - userInterface

    - userInput
    - userOutput
    - userInteraction
    - userFeedback
    - userPreferences
    - userContext
    - userHistory
    - userLocation
    - userTime

Implementing the concept of uploading your brain to the cloud and having a conversational interface with it from any device, anywhere, requires a sophisticated integration of several technologies. Here's how we could approach the implementation of each component:

Core Elements:
Data Definitions: Establish a clear schema for user data, ensuring compatibility across different applications.
Data Storage: Use both local and cloud storage to save data, ensuring redundancy and accessibility.
Data Transit: Securely transfer data between devices and the cloud, with encryption and integrity checks.
Security:
Authentication: Implement strong user verification methods, possibly using biometrics for added security.
Authorization: Define access controls, ensuring users can only access their own brain uploads and conversations.
User Interface:
User Input: Develop speech-to-text capabilities for user communication.
User Output: Implement text-to-speech for the system to communicate back to the user.
User Interaction: Create a responsive interface that adapts to various devices and user behaviors.
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on system performance and accuracy.
User Preferences: Give users control over their preferences and settings.
User Context: Context-aware processing to understand the situation around user queries.
User History: Maintain conversation logs to provide continuity across sessions.
User Location: Use geolocation to provide personalized responses based on user location.
User Time: Integrate with the user's schedule and time zone for timely interactions.
Application-Specific Elements:
EyeContact: Face recognition for user authentication and interaction.
VoiceBox: Speech recognition and processing for natural language understanding.
EarWig: Text-to-speech for audible responses.
BrainStorm: A growing knowledge base that learns from interactions.
WebCrawler: A search engine to pull in new information and update the knowledge base.
WebPublisher: A content management system for sharing updates to the web.
To achieve this, you'd need to develop a series of applications that handle these functionalities, ensuring they can interact and share data securely. 
This system would represent an advanced personal assistant, capable of learning and adapting to the user's needs over time. 
It would require a solid backend infrastructure, machine learning models for natural language processing, robust security measures, and a seamless front-end experience.
