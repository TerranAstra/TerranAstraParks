we are going to write a series of scripts to create some local folders & files

we also want to create some scripts that will populate the files with some engineered prompts for our ai 

our ai will be comprised of multiple "personas"

each persona will have a unique name, and will be comprised of a series of files

each file will have a unique name, and will be comprised of a series of prompts

it's important to note that these files will be based on templates

the templates will be stored in a separate folder

the templates will be comprised of a series of prompts, with VALUE_PLACEHOLDERS

the VALUE_PLACEHOLDERS will be replaced with actual values when the files are created

the actual values will be derived by calling a series of functions, passing in "my" (my persona) name as a parameter, as well as the result of some locally performed calculations

the locally performed calculations will be based on the persona's name, as well as some common elements shared by all of the personas, in one session

the most important of these common elements will be the "platinumVector"

the platinumVector will be a series of values, each of which will be used to calculate a value for a specific prompt
    "my person" (not to be confused with "my persona")
    time
    place
    direction i was looking
    quick snapshot of the scene, at that time

I have created a script that sets up the necessary infrastructure for your AI personas. This script:

Generates a unique "platinumVector" for each persona, based on their name, current time, location, direction, and a snapshot of the scene.
Utilizes templates with VALUE_PLACEHOLDERS, replacing them with actual values derived from functions and the platinumVector.
Creates a directory for each persona and populates it with files based on these templates.
Each file contains a series of prompts tailored to the persona's unique attributes.
The files and folders for the personas have been created in a directory located at /mnt/data/personas. Each persona's folder contains files filled with prompts derived from the templates and personalized with the calculated values.

This setup is designed to support multiple personas, each with their unique characteristics and prompt files, facilitating a diverse and rich AI environment.â€‹
