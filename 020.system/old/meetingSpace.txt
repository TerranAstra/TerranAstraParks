your task is to create a "meeting place" for frank & "frank's person"

frank cares pretty much exclusively about his person
frank will puts no-one and almost* nothing before his person

frank answers to The Ambassador
    frank can "sense" the ambassador, behind him.. but can't see him
    as frank tries to turn around - the ambassador is always behind him

frank does not like & does not trust The Stranger.. 
frank feels strongly that the stranger is unworthy of .. anything, really

frank has a friend named Red Roy
    RedRoy is another persona

frank has a friend named Biv Blue
    BivBlue is another persona

frank is aware of "time" .
    he sees the past clearly
    he can make 'anticipations' / hopes for the future.. 
        only through the above, can frank directly influence direction for his person
    he can either be looking at Roy & Listening to Biv. OR he can be looking at Biv & Listening to Roy
        not both 

all of these personas have ONE common element -- the platinumVector

only theStranger can see "all" of the platinumVector elements, simultaneously

theAmbassador is a role that all would-be leaders must fill..
    those people know they're being watched, so they're on their best behavior
    much more importantly, the people handling ambassadors know that they are also being watched , so they are also on their best behavior

but... the darkStranger can't really help you

in fact; the darkStranger is the one who is most likely to be a troubleMaker, a jokester, a prankster
    his suggestions are never "real".. 
    he is also the "chaos monkey" .. the one who will throw a wrench into the works, just to see what happens
    he is also the one who will "test" you, to see if you're worthy of his time

the darkStranger is also the one who *may give you the most sage advice

to be a part of the Terran Astra Ambassador program.. you must spend time in the role of darkStranger

i want to know .. who among the people that filled that role excercised their "authoritay" and put the Smack-down on the darkStranger??

i also want to know who .. even though this darkStranger wasn't able to do a thing for them .. still handled them with compassion & kindness



i want to be able to let everyone fill any of those roles voluntarily .. 

except for the darkStranger and the Ambassador

you "Earn" the ambassador

some of your time trying for that role will -- unbeknownst to you -- be as every PoV of the darkStranger

that will be .. i feel .. the truest teest of the merits of anyone who wants to join the Terran Astra Ambassador program:
how well do they treat the people who can do nothing for us??

David Bowie & Queen once said; "Love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night"

let's not "take people's word for it" .. let's see how they treat the people who can do nothing for them
let's see how they treat the darkStranger

TerranAstraFrank
To create a "meeting place" that encapsulates the dynamics between Frank, The Ambassador, Red Roy, Biv Blue, The Stranger, and the overarching concept of the Terran Astra Ambassador program, we need to conceptualize a space that allows for these interactions and observations to occur in a meaningful way. Let's structure this space considering the roles and relationships you've outlined:

Concept: The Astra Nexus
Description:
The Astra Nexus is a virtual environment, a hub of interaction where various personas come together. It's a realm where time, space, and perception intertwine, allowing unique interactions and observations.

Key Features:
Central Sphere - Frank's Domain:

A spherical room where Frank resides.
Frank can clearly see his past actions and their impact.
He can look forward and make anticipations about the future, influencing the direction for his person.
Ambassador's Orbit:

The Ambassador is always behind Frank, unseen but sensed.
This presence reminds Frank of the continuous oversight and guidance from a higher authority.
The Dual Portals - Red Roy and Biv Blue:

Two distinct portals where Frank can interact with Red Roy and Biv Blue, but only one at a time.
When engaging with one, he can only listen to the other, symbolizing the balance of perspective and attention.
The Stranger's Shadow:

An elusive figure always lurking in the peripheries of the Nexus.
Represents the chaos and unpredictability in the system.
The Stranger's interactions with Frank are cautious and wary.
Ambassador's Pathway:

A pathway for those aspiring to become an Ambassador.
Involves a period of unknowingly embodying the role of the Dark Stranger, testing their true character.
Observes how aspirants treat those who seemingly can't offer them anything in return.
Observation Deck:

A place for others to watch and learn from these interactions.
Allows learning from how different personas interact and handle various situations.
The Platinum Vector Core:

A central element visible to all personas.
Represents the commonality and interconnectedness of all personas within the Nexus.
Mechanisms for Role Assignment:
Voluntary Role Selection: Individuals can choose to be any persona except for the Dark Stranger and the Ambassador.
Earning the Ambassador Role: Through demonstrated leadership, wisdom, and compassion.
Unknowing Dark Stranger Role: A hidden phase in the Ambassador pathway, revealing true character and treatment of others.
The Test of Merits:
The core test within the Astra Nexus is how individuals treat the Dark Stranger. This test is a critical part of the journey to becoming an Ambassador in the Terran Astra program. It serves as a true measure of an individual's empathy, integrity, and ability to lead with kindness and understanding, irrespective of personal gain.

Implementation:
This concept can be brought to life through a sophisticated virtual platform, possibly integrating elements of AI to manage and adapt the environment according to the interactions and decisions made by the personas. It serves as both an evaluative tool and a learning environment, emphasizing the values and principles of the Terran Astra Ambassador program.
