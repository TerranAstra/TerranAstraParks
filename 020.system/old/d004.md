can you emit a codeFile that can fully encompass the "create an openai assistant" process?
we want to 
make the assistant
upload files to it
create a thread
add 2+ messages
make sure the question will be long-running enough to kick off some "streaming" responses
handle the responses, as streams
save the salient bits to a file
conditionally delete the assistant 

Example: 
```csharp
// create the reference to the secrets, which will be stored elsewhere
    // var secrets = new Secrets();
// create the reference to the storage
// create a reference to the openai object - which should be static / singleton
// create an assistant - this is an instantiable object
// create a thread 
// create a message
    // add it to the thread
// create a 2nd message
    // add it to the thread
// run the thread
// get the streaming output
    // stream onto the console or screen
// save the streaming output to storage
