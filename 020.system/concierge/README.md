imagine you're walking into a 5 star hotel - the concierge knows where to connect you.. it's your connection to the party line. 

meant to be designed & used as an MMO-style `game`, this would be like having an avatar in some of the popular MMO games.. they support 'cookie-cutter' approaches to realms.. both in terms of the structure but also the operations. we want to create each city / town following some of those patterns, while also designing new ones (not just geographical-accuracy, but also down-to-the-neighborhood forms of communication)

---
going to need some help from game designer(s) :-/

---
i want this to be a new `version` pretty regularly 

those versions should be `culminations` of 
 - global+ (`Frank`)
 - Country (Terran)
 - City (`Shared`?)
 - Town (Frank)
 - Neighborhood (Frank)
 - Citizens (Frank)
 - "_`Non-Frank`_" people..? LoL - Need a name for people who opt-out.. they'll still have a voice in anything they choose. Goal is to make a system that is so desirable that it becomes increasingly `worth it` to just agree to a few things

 ---
 Designed as a means of sharing & `democratizing` things into both `Categorization` & `Classification`

categorizations kinda need to be global, whereas classifications are inherently subjective & local 

---
meant to be a "New LIbrary of Alexandria" .. i want to _find_ all of the knowledge of the world, and _show & share_ all of it, too..
