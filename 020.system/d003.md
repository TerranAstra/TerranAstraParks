yes - let's write a wrapper for those pieces of the functionality
it seems we should be able to create one "object" on my computer
we want to be able to reference it, through dot.notation
"Kiosk" is always our object .. it describes a "blackbox" of hardware
we can have only exactly one "Kiosk" object - it's always a static / singleton

the kiosk can also be thought of as a "factory" or .. if we get there.. a "factory of factories"

in this case; we want our factory to be able to serve a bunch of openai "widgets"
for the long-term vision; the widget in question should not matter
we have a long-term vision of adding any other api as a toolSet in the kiosk toolBox 
for now; we want to be able to reference anything that CAN be referenced hierarchically, in a hierarchical fashion

this cuold mean engineering something that doesn't exist 
before we write our 'wrapper', i want to explore that 

ultimately; we want a system where -- instead of (or in addition to?) writing a class for each api -- we write the wrapper object to be able to reference any api, and then we write a class for each api that we want to use?

we need to be able to track the state of the api - that implies some back-end storage, retrieval, processing, and display

if we can look at stubbing that out - i'd like that .. 
but -- this automated assistant could be key in making all of that happen far more quickly 
so -- please write a wrapper around the assitant object .. 
we want to write this in stages .. let's use C# and visual studio .. c# supports partial classes .. we want each "piece" of this to be its own partial class ..

our structure is going to be something like this:

Kiosk
    - KioskAssistant[]
    - Assistant.Add()
    - Assistant.Remove()
        - Assistant.Files[]
        - KioskAssistant[0]
        - KioskAssistant[1]
        - KioskAssistant[2]
        - KioskAssistant[3]
        - KioskAssistant[4]
        - KioskAssistant[5]
        - KioskAssistant[6]
    - KioskAssistant[7]
        - KioskAssistant[7].Files[]
            - KioskAssistant[7].Files.Add()
    - Threads[]
    - ThreadMessages[]
    - ThreadMessages.Add()
    - Thread.Run()
    - Thread.Stop()
    - var streamingOutput = await async Thread.StreamingOutput # this needs to be handled correctly
    - Thread.StreamingOutput.SaveToStorage(myArgs, storageArgs) 
    - - # myArgs should include info about the assistant, thread, and message
    - - # storageArgs should include info about the storage location - a fully-ready-to-go storage object, from a different kiosk object, for Azure (AWS, GCP, etc)

if we make all of this as a console app, can that be utilized by ui wrappers, later?
