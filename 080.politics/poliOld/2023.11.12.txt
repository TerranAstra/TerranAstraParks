goals / your tasks

let's revise this prompt until we get a full dictionary of terms

let's begin creating the preliminary of several of our applications

let's do everything we can to ensure that you read your content from a Ci/Cd pipeline that is maintained as part of the code & programs we are going to write, today 

let's maximize each day .. we want each day to have schedules of 3 parts
 - links to what we did yesterday/before
 - a list of action items for today
 - a place for tracking things that came across our desk today, but need to be put off until tomorrow/later
we want to create a livingSchedule that allows myPerson to track their day(s) across "cycles" 5 days / week / 10, 14, 28, 30, 73, 90, 365.24, etc 

tracking time will be realtive to myPerson
 - we don't only* track if something is happening "at 7 pm" 
 - - that measure is also "12 hours after myPerson got up", "3 hours or so before myPerson goes to bed", etc... 
 - - point being - we want to track time relative to unique points of view (myPerson) and not exclusively by the naval observatory clock
