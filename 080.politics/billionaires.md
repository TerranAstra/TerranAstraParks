Population: [8,200,000,000](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#:~:text=8.2%20Billion%20(current))

Billionaires: [2,700+](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/04/02/forbes-worlds-billionaires-list-2024-the-top-200/)

there are 3 million + of us for every 1 of them

if the width of Billionaiers was a human hair: [0.1 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair%27s_breadth) 

if the b class is 1 hair's width wide .. the rest of us are 9,842 feet ( > 3,000 meters)

if there are 3 million of us for each - that's a human hair that's 5,592,045 miles long 

according to whatever this is.. there's "old money" - waiting in vaults - that renders today's currencies moot
