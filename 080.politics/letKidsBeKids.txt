i can't be the only one sick of seeing kids-as-pawns

if you are involved with even putting incendiary topics into the heads of kids - that's thin ice

if you are telling kids that *THEY* are embracers of this/that incendiary topic - i am absolutely prepared to pass laws against it

i do not care WHICH of these incendiary topics -- if your stance is 'my position is righteous & justified so i shove my ism in people's faces' - you are already wrong

if you've extended the above to children - you are wrong
 - on the left, you can see clearly that having kids around guns is indoctrination. 
 - on the right; i absolutly

as long as you are able to believe 'negative is the term that describes *them*' ..
