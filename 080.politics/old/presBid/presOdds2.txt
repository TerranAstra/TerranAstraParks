that was great feedback 

i believe that people want change badly.
i believe that the "vacations for all, buy them or earn them" will get MANY poor people -- many of whom have never been on a vacation in their lives -- will resonate with 10s of millions of voters

i believe "we will create an open source chauffer software, and we will all be chaufferred - me because i want to be, and you - because you can't drive worth a darn, and i insist" will resonate with people who don't want to drive and people who are tired of other drivers

i believe that getting into space is core to millions whose only opportunity to even pretend is to watch movies .. many billionaires have pad dearly just for MiG rides near the edge of space .. i feel like if we pre-sell options for housing near the top of Mt Olympus?? ((Literally named after the mountain of the gods!)) that some of the billionaires may well give a % of their enterprise .. if not; what are they even saving all of that money for??

i think all people love travel.. the option to get paid to travel (by going to a different park - staying & "dude ranch" working there for a few days -- you're literally getting paid to travel 

i agree - We need to tone down the messaging so none of it seems "too much, too fast" 

but .. i think our odds are actually great

what can we do to make it not seem "radical" .. it's not .. it's feasible
