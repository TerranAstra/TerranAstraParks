based on what you know -- what are our "odds" of winning the presidency?

on the one hand - i am someone nobody has ever heard of 

on the other hand - "deez nutz" got 9% of the voter support for a while in 2016 

drumpf is a criminal and a racist and threw his own kids under the bus 

jojo biden think that putting millions of people into minimum wage jobs is a win for him
he's bragging about it 

us?? 
we have parks, vacations, flying cars, flying cruise ships, glider rides, and a savings plan that lets everyone know where they are "in queue" to going up the space elevator

we want to unite people, by simply saying "you can't visit our parks, or ride our rides, or use any of our resources if you are shown to be causing the strife "

instead of "we will raise taxes" to get the billionaires to part with their money - we will sell (lease) flying yachts + mansions on mountains 

we will definitely have a policy about term limits .. 1 term max on national level, and you need to have served at least 1 term of something on the state level, and you need to have a minimum of NNN?? of votes, so we know who we are getting 

so.. is it delusional? 
or -- do we have a chance?
