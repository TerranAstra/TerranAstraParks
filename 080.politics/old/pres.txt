We are going to become president
in the 2024 elecetion - it's joe biden , donald drumpf (we don't call him trump) and us
so really - there's just us 

we are running as independent 

biden has "sided" too much w the left
drumpf is a racist and a liar and a theif and a criminal and possibly the beast of revelations

your task ... 
let's get some ideas for what are some next steps??

we need to find a campaign manager
    - who are some great campaign managers, from recent presidential runs? doesn't matter if they won or lost

we need to find a campaign slogan

how do we get the message out?

what are some means of raising capital?

who are the people best-suited to match these needs??
