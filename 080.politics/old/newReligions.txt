we can all see it - the fine detils that divide.. 
	no matter how deeply we "must" dig; we find them - and we hammer them 

we can look to the shia / sunni divide

we can also see "pendulum".. 
	once, in 1930s; jews were herded into ghettos
	- disarmed, starved, eventually gassed
	- now, palestinans are herded into what are basically ghettos
	- disarmed, starving, regularly beaten
	- - show a picture of a kid, stapled to the war machine
