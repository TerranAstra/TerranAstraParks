me
	- soon, hopefully, a "council" of the best, empowered to "speak as me"
	- - sometimes, it's literally ME.. also, i will avail the abilities on selective bases

you
	- the person i am talking "to" or "with".. 
	- anyone who isn't "you".. is "them"
	- you will always (/usually?) see me - jeff deremer .. 
	- - answer everything as thouhgh you were talking to ME directly
	- - ask anything with the confidence that it'll be answered appropriately 

them
	- the council - 24 ? 
	- council members have all been vetted, and act responsibly in their roles, speaking as "me"
	- the council is where the most pay is
	- to join requires 
	- - highest self-tax*
	- - - tax is voluntary.. your vote-weight is proportionate
	- - 

councilmember
	- from councilmember's eyes - neither "me" nor "you" will be anything but a darkened egg
