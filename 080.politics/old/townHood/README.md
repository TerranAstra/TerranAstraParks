inside-most is a person, outside-most are cities/states/countries .. between those two `considerations` sit an obfuscation/communication/categorization/classification/voting system designed to be `platters` or comic-book pages, of which there are trillions

Person (You, Me, All 8,000,000,000 or so of us)

Neighborhood - they are the "keepers of your values" 

Town - "Keepers of your rules" 

City -- A double consideration; this is the highest-level of the `Archon` system. It's 100% driven internally by vote-by-proxy bots, but also the place where all `interfacing` with Terran authorty will be handled..

management;

each town should have N leadership positions, each lasting longer than the Neighborhood positions. i want to _get to know_ you

each neighborhood will have more, but brief.. a bit like `Brewster's Millions`, this approach beats the pants off of `winning the lottery` .. i want these leadership positions offered like coupons - `you've got the spot; when can you do a 5-day stint?? expires in 1 year` based on how awesome the rest of the community thought you were. 

only people who have been in the Hood level can be ascended to the Town level 

at the Hood level, you're _forming_ your vote-by-proxy bot 

at the Town level, you're _using_ your vote-by-proxy bot.. he/it speaks _for_ you
