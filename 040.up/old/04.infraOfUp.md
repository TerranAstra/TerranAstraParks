Flying Cars –1: Pods
•My Own Space - No "Wet Spot"
•A place to confidently leave my stuff..
•Affordable - (like daily transportation)
•With an option of special occasions (like renting a race car)
•Sizing Standards  [A, B, C, etc.] (like batteries)
•Small like a Smart car / medium like "efficiency" apt / large like home-sized
•Safety vs. Mobility Spectrum  ..
•Doing 2mph on the ground? -- bamboo is fine
•Doing 200mph in the air? -- safety-engineered version
•Ratings  [Land, Sea, Air]

Gliders
•Gliders are mobility units, minus the engines•I can't wait for something better than a roller coaster, in my own personal pod
•I am so excited to get queued for take-off at 7:45 for an 8:00 pm sunset, and an hour's glide ride
•Powering / launching:•Some gas engine? Some slingshot? Some railgun? Some high pressure in an air tunnel*?
•That last being the most exciting –if we can produce that along a ridgeline of a mountain?? We could potentially find a new means of launching...
•Maybe there are some engineers out there, who are also excited to explore this new means of both fun & mobility
•Achieve maximum speed & height, then autonomous glide
•Either return to that same location, or go to the next location, for more adventures, tomorrow
•Always a new sunrise

Flying Cars 2: 'Chassis' / Mobility - Design
•imagine  a Box truck, but your Pod would be the "box"
•We are going to apply the "box-truck" concept to flying  cars
•Hopefully –also to water, land, etc.
•Similar also to trains, with 6-8 small Pods / 2-3 "efficiencies"  on each
•"Modular" / "Lego"-esque "Shoebox" | "cubby" design
•designed around the sizes of Pods [A, B, C, etc.]
•Three rules; 1: Redundancy 2: Redundancy 3: Redundancy
•No ownership  / internationally  operated
•More on that in the "Buses" section
•All 'Chauffeured'  (as opposed  to individually  controlled)

Flying Cars - Buses –Design
•Infrastructure, with multiple sizes & types of "cubbies", for different sized Pods
•From single-use yachts to a cruise ships for thousands
•Personal like a yacht –still not "owned"
•Airplane –a dozen or two folks, all headed in the same direction
•Huge -- Local –like apartment complexes / parks for one place
•Huge -- Express –hybrid of cruise ships and cargo ships

Flying Cars –Buses –Hulls & Balloons
•Same three rules about Redundancy
•If the titanic had been designed with redundancy as the Core principle;  even when 3/8ths got 
smashed by an iceberg, 5/8ths should have been fully functioning "segments"
•Extend that kind of thinking
•Segments are loaded with hydrogen "balloons" which can be inflated / deflated 
to change elevation
•Segments are then flooded with Nitrogen, between the balloons
•Even if a balloon leaks; the contents of the segments get cycled regularly  –leak 
can be identified, corrected, never cause a problem.. even if an entire segment 
needs to be replaced

Flying Cars - 3) Buses –Worries [Operation]
•No ownership  of these  things..
•We saw the reactions to spy balloons.
•Those were helium
•And small
•We can't get shot down
•A million reasons –we need to prevent misuse
•no disgruntled former employees
•no Spying
•No jihad
•There's a million examples...

"ice halo" - tackle global warming
•One the number  one crises facing  humanity  right now is Global 
Warming. We must "turn down the thermostat"
•A major symptom has been  the disappearance  of the  Arctic ice caps
•To supplement  their  important reflective ability, I'd like to experiment 
w propulsion  in upper  atmosphere
•Blast ribbons of steam –very wide contrails, lasting potentially hours
•We can actually get started w this  relatively quickly. Although  we are 
designing  this around  propulsion  for the Buses,  it's important to note 
that we can sell bus  rides  and save the planet
•Your "Vacation" is humanity's "Salvation"

Space Elevator
•I don't just dream of flying cars, I want to accelerate the process  of moving humanity  forward on its quest  to explore outer space
•This is a very long term consideration 
•I don't see rockets as the right way of getting  into space
•I want to explore launching  from a platform that is already as close as possible  to the upper  reaches of the stratosphere
•Create 1,000 or so "platforms"  / "stages", each engineered  uniquely for each level of the atmosphere
•Their 1 design  spec; stay put, regardless  of temperature  and wind changes

Shipyard on top of the stratosphere
•The largest  & top-most of the sections  of the Space Elevator
•Float a massive "boat" - which  is also a ship  yard - as close to the top 
of the stratosphere  as possible.. (50 km is top –30-40 km?)
•Strato-Boats
•Construct rigid bodies from extremely lightweight materials
•Empty their hulls.. When they fall back on top of the stratosphere –no matter 
how thin at the top –they should float
•"Void-based displacement" should 100% be feasible! - I can't wait to have a 
boat that floats because of [NULL]
•"Dear Billionaire  class: These are the yachts you want!"

Flying Cars –Closing
•These  ideas  seem feasible  to pursue,  right now
•I don't want to be beholden  to profits  and the demands  of the 
insatiable  few
•We need  a "resource"-raiser
•Not a "fund" raiser, because I don't want to think in terms of "dollars"
•Terran Astra Parks –definitely where you want to go, for your next outing!
