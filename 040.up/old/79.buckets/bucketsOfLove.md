## "buckets of Love" 

i've got a feeling that the fires of 2023 are the start of a trend that is going to continue

our buses will need ballast

that ballast will sometimes be stone, from the mountains

but - we will be flying through countless millions of gallons of available fresh water -- in the form of clouds -- nonstop
condensing that into fresh water, and then dumping the loads of water ballast onto hot-spots ~could~ be a way to help fight fires

while this idea may clearly seem 'far-flung' on its surface.. my guess is that Maui & Greece would have been happy to have had this option
