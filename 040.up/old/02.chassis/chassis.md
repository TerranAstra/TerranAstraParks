# Chassis

think of the chassis of your car - all of the 'expensive' stuff is a hassle. we don't all _need_ tires, engines, gas tanks, electrical storage, heating & air, and -- most importantly -- navigation 

chassis is all of those things, in cusomtizable sizes to accomadate the dozen or so sizes of Pod

chassis would also be the basis for 'lifting' a pod, whether to your own personal boat, or a shared bus-boat. 

when `flying car` style chassis, these are not quad-copter design, but rather `flying carpet` in almost a tugboat looking configuration
