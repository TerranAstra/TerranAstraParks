# Space Elevator

gist is -- every few hundred feet, another 'vertebrate'

we have hundreds (thousands?) of such sections, each tasked with staying stationary, regardless of anything else

design spec is that any 2 or even 3 of these in a row should be able to fail, with no loss in capability

'track' should be hundreds of feet long.. first foot or so 1%, then 3, then ++
the middle of the track would be closest to 100%, then back to minimal 

track will span 5, 6, 8 (?) of the vertebrate segments

obviously; not affordable for anything under ~~ "trillion" ish...?
