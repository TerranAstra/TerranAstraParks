## Gliders

people need something to look forward to
my S.O. says "people have that" .. but she's in her 50s.. SHE has that 

there's a part of me that's never moved even a little bit past 14 .. 

that part of me craves newer challenges, loftier goals, and more exciting adventures

i want to create an "initiative of up" .. 

phase 1 -- our gliders

 we need to test structural safety at speed, landings (crash landings) and all possible means of getting maximum movement, while carrying a minimum of the energy required to autonomously generate motion 

the gliders could also be though of as "landing pods" in case of an emergency from the buses
we don't yet have buses.. but we should be able to get started on testing & safety -- using gliders -- right away 

that gives every blue-blooded american kid something violently american to look forward to
 - trebuchet
 - rail-gun
 - high-pressure
 - good ol' fashioned american horsepwower
by whatever means necessary; we are going to explore a new kinds of launch system 
it will ultimately have numerous other applicability, but for now, the 'easy sell' is excitement
