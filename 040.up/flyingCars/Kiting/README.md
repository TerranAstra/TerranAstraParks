# Kiting

gist; create a 3 part fusion of balloons/kites/sailboats

attach to ground/water based craft, "practice" designs 

designs for the [Buses](https://github.com/TheseApps/TerranAstra-FlyingCars/tree/main/BusBoat), but also cables for the [Space Elevator](https://github.com/TheseApps/TerranAstra-FlyingCars/tree/main/SpaceElevator)

at present, we are not allowed to make "airships" using hydrogen.. no people inside

imagine a large boat shaped device, except instead of sails, it has a small(ish) version of one of the boats

current sailboats can "tack" straight into the wind.. we don't need to go "into" the wind, but we do want to be able to capture tacking

assume we are going in the direction of the winds.. [~15-20 mph at under a mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed)

note that if this was engineered correctly; we could have sailing boats that could 'hop'

note that if done correctly; kite-ships could serve as prototype for express-type buses, and also could get practice with moving people, by moving packages
