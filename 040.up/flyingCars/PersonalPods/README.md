# Pods

we want the pricing of today's city bus, but without the worry of whatever came before (nobody wants to sit in anyone else's wet spot)
the security of being able to keep your stuff, your way.. 

Pods can be as samll as 'smart cars' / a city bus seat / an airplane seat 

Medium - Small can be about the size of a restaurant booth or office cubicle 

Large - Small : almost an 'efficiency'.. 

and so on
