not sure about that name - maybe "ice Ribbon"...? 

summary; jet contrails, but to an extreme

as the buses circumnavigate the earth, they will do so by collecting energy, and then expending it to maintain forward motion

whether that motion comes in the form of air that is heated and/or compressed, we have the option of injecting water into that mix

as the steam comes out of the back it will freeze, but in a significantly wider form than jet contrails

if we are able to do this from dozens of these buses, all day every day (or as needed) we will be able to create "ribbons" of ice around the earth

these ribbons will be able to reflect sunlight back into space, and will be able to cool the earth

the buses will be able to do this in a way that is not harmful to the environment

## How it works

the buses will be able to 
 - collect energy from the sun, and then use that energy to heat and/or compress air
  - collect water from the air / clouds, and then use that water to create steam
 - blast ribbons of steam high into the air, which will -- hopefully -- create artificial shadow
   - wider than contrails, higher up, with significantly more water, and will hopefully last much longer
