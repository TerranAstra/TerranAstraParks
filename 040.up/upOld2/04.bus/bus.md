# Bus - Boat

2 types
 - stationary / local
 - in motion / express

local bus can stay put (mostly?)

or move in a circle around one city / town

express for transportation between cities

if terran water sailboats can work with [Tacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacking_(sailing)), then our buses can too
